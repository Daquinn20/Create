### Stock Markets Struggle to Digest Jobs Data. How the Fed Can Soothe Fears.
*Received: Wed, 17 Dec 2025 22:57:37 +1100*

- **Jobs Data Overview**: The U.S. unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, a four-year high, primarily due to increased workforce participation rather than a collapsing labor market. This mixed employment data suggests some economic uncertainty, particularly affecting job seekers during the holiday season.

- **Federal Reserve Insights**: The market anticipates the Fed to pause interest rate cuts in January, with possible cuts in March as economic conditions evolve. Low oil prices and easing tariff pressures contribute to this outlook, supporting valuations in the tech sector, particularly amid concerns around the artificial intelligence bubble.

- **Future Considerations**: Attention will shift to the appointment of a new Fed chair in early 2026, alongside political pressures for rate reductions from President Donald Trump. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic cautioned against further rate cuts, warning it could undermine the Fed's credibility in managing inflation.

- **Actionable Insights**: Investors are cautioned against making hasty decisions based on isolated reports, as past experiences with companies like Microsoft and Micron Technology show that market fears can be overblown and temporary. Maintaining a long-term perspective could prevent regrets stemming from knee-jerk reactions to current market instability in the AI space.
