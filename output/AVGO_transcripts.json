      "content": "Ji Yoo: Welcome to Broadcom Inc.'s Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ji Yoo, Head of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc. Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President and CEO, Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer, and Charlie Coaz, President, Semiconductor Solutions Group. Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market closed describing our financial performance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the investor section of Broadcom's website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and an audio replay of the call can be accessed for one year through the Investors section of Broadcom's website. During the prepared remarks, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 results, guidance for 2026, as well as commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Hock.\nHock Tan: And thank you everyone for joining us today. Well, we just ended our Q4 fiscal 2025. And before I get into details of that quarter, let me recap the year. In our fiscal 2025, consolidated revenue grew 24% year over year, to a record $64 billion, driven by AI semiconductors and VMware. AI revenue grew 65% year over year to $20 billion, driving the semiconductor revenue for this company to a record $37 billion for the year. In our infrastructure software business, strong adoption of VMware Cloud Foundation, or VCF as we call it, drove revenue growth of 26% year on year to $27 billion. In summary, 2025 was another strong year for Broadcom. And we see the spending momentum by our customers for AI continuing to accelerate in 2026. Now let's move on to the results of our fourth quarter 2025. Total revenue was a record $18 billion, up 28% year on year and above our guidance on better than expected growth in AI semiconductors as well as infrastructure software. Q4 consolidated adjusted EBITDA was a record $12.12 billion, up 34% year on year. So let me give you more color on our two segments. In semiconductors, revenue was $11.1 billion as year on year growth accelerated to 35%. This robust growth was driven by AI semiconductor revenue of $6.5 billion, which was up 74% year on year. This represents a growth trajectory exceeding 10 times over the eleven quarters we have reported this line of business. Our customer accelerated business more than doubled year over year as we see our customers increase adoption of XPUs, as we call those customer accelerators, in training their LLMs and monetizing their platforms through inferencing APIs and applications. These XPUs, I may add, are not only being used to train and inference internal workloads by our customers. The same experience in some situations has been extended externally to other LLM peers. Best exemplified at Google where the TPUs used in creating Gemini are also being used for AI cloud computing by Apple, Cohere, and SSI as a sample. The scale at which we see this happening could be significant. As you are aware, last quarter, Q3 2025, we received a $10 billion order to sell the latest TPU ironwood racks to Anthropic. This was our fourth custom. That we mentioned. In this quarter Q4, we received an additional $11 billion order from this same customer for delivery in late 2026. But that does not mean our other two customers are using TPUs. In fact, they prefer to control their own destiny by continuing to drive their multiyear journey to create their own custom AI accelerators or XPU RECs as we call them. I am pleased today to report that during this quarter, we acquired a fifth XPU customer through a $1 billion order placed for delivery in late 2026. Now moving on to AI networking. Demand here has even been stronger as we see customers build out their data center infrastructure ahead of deploying AI accelerators. Our current order backlog for AI switches exceeds $10 billion as our latest 102 terabyte terabit per second Tomahawk six switch, the first and only one of its capability out there, continues to book at record rates. This is just a subset of what we have. We have also secured record orders on DSPs, optical components like lasers, and PCI Express switches to be deployed in AI data centers. All these components combined with our XPUs bring our total order on hand in excess of $73 billion today, which is almost half Broadcom's consolidated backlog of $162 billion. We expect this $73 billion in AI backlog to be delivered over the next eighteen months. In Q1 fiscal 2026, we expect our AI revenue to double year on year to $8.2 billion. Turning to non-AI semiconductors, Q4 revenue of $4.6 billion was up 2% year on year and up 16% sequentially based on favorable wireless seasonality. Year on year, broadband showed solid recovery. Wireless was flat. All the other end markets were down as enterprise spending continued to show limited signs of recovery. Accordingly, in Q1, we forecast non-AI semiconductor revenue to be approximately $4.1 billion, flat from a year ago, down sequentially due to wireless seasonality. Let me now talk about our infrastructure software segment. Q4 Infrastructure Software revenue of $6.9 billion was up 19% year on year, both and above our outlook of 6.7. Bookings continued to be strong, as total contract value booked in Q4 exceeded $10.4 billion versus $8.2 billion a year ago. We ended the year with $73 billion of infrastructure software backlog, up from $49 billion a year ago. We expect renewals to be seasonal in Q1 and forecast infrastructure software revenue to be approximately $6.8 billion. We still expect, however, that for fiscal 2026, Infrastructure Software revenue to grow low double-digit percentage. So here's what we see in 2026. Directionally, we expect AI revenue to continue to accelerate and drive most of our growth. Non-AI semiconductor revenue to be stable. Infrastructure software revenue will continue to be driven by VMware growth at low double digits. For Q1 2026, we expect consolidated revenue of approximately $19.1 billion, up 28% year on year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 67% of revenue. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\nKirsten Spears: Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q4 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was a record $18 billion for the quarter, up 28% from a year ago. Gross margin was 77.9% of revenue in the quarter, better than we originally guided on higher software revenues and product mix within semiconductors. Consolidated operating expenses were $2.1 billion, of which $1.5 billion was research and development. Q4 operating income was a record $11.9 billion, up 35% from a year ago. Now on a sequential basis, even as gross margin was down 50 basis points on semiconductor product mix, operating margin increased 70 basis points sequentially to 66.2% on favorable operating leverage. Adjusted EBITDA of $12.12 billion or 68% of revenue was above our guidance of 67%. This figure excludes $148 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments. Starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was a record $11.1 billion with growth accelerating to 35% year on year driven by AI. Semiconductor revenue represented 61% of total revenue in the quarter. Gross margin for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was approximately 68%. Operating expenses increased 16% year on year, to $1.1 billion on increased investment in R&D for leading-edge AI semiconductors. Semiconductor operating margin of 59% was up 250 basis points year on year. Now moving to infrastructure software. Revenue for Infrastructure Software of $6.9 billion was up 19% year on year and represented 39% of total revenue. Gross margin for infrastructure software was 93% in the quarter compared to 91% a year ago. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in Infrastructure Software operating margin of 78%. This compares to operating margin of 72% a year ago reflecting the completion of the integration of VMware. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $7.5 billion and represented 41% of revenue. We spent $237 million on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were thirty-six days in the fourth quarter, compared to twenty-nine days a year ago. We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $2.3 billion, up 4% sequentially. Our days of inventory on hand were fifty-eight days in Q4, compared to sixty-six days in Q3 as we continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the fourth quarter with $16.2 billion of cash, up $5.5 billion sequentially on strong cash flow generation. The weighted average coupon rate in years to maturity of our gross principal fixed rate debt of $67.1 billion is 4% and 7.2 years, respectively. Turning to capital allocation. In Q4, we paid stockholders $2.8 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.59 per share. In Q1, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be 4.97 billion shares excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases. Now let me recap our financial performance for fiscal year 2025. Our revenue hit a record $63.9 billion with organic growth accelerating to 24% year on year. Semiconductor revenue was $36.9 billion, up 22% year over year. Infrastructure software revenue was $27 billion, up 26% year on year. Fiscal 2025 adjusted EBITDA was $43 billion and represented 67% of revenue. Free cash flow grew 39% year on year to $26.9 billion. For fiscal 2025, we returned $17.5 billion of cash to shareholders in the form of $11.1 billion of dividends and $6.4 billion in share repurchases and eliminations. Aligned with our ability to generate increased cash flows in the preceding year, we are announcing an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2026 to 65\u00a2 per share, an increase of 10% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal 2026, subject to quarterly board approval. This implies our fiscal 2026 annual common stock dividend to be a record $2.60 per share, an increase of 10% year on year. I would like to highlight that this represents the fifteenth consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011. The board also approved an extension of our share repurchase program of which $7.5 billion remains, through the end of calendar year 2026. Now moving to guidance. Our guidance for Q1 is for consolidated revenue of $19.1 billion, up 28% year on year. We forecast semiconductor revenue of approximately $12.3 billion, up 50% year on year. Within this, we expect Q1 AI semiconductor revenue of $8.2 billion, up approximately 100% year on year. We expect infrastructure software revenue of approximately $6.8 billion, up 2% year on year. For your modeling purposes, we expect Q1 consolidated gross margin to be down approximately 100 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting a higher mix of AI revenue. As a reminder, consolidated gross margins through the year will be impacted by the revenue mix of infrastructure software and semiconductors and also product mix within semiconductor. Expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 67%. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate for Q1 and fiscal year 2026 to increase from 14% to approximately 6.5% due to the impact of the global minimum tax and shift in geographic mix of income compared to that of fiscal year 2025. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Due to time restraints, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Please stand by while we come to our first question.\nVivek Arya: Our first question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nHock Tan: Thank you. Just wanted to clarify, Hock, you said $73 billion over eighteen months for AI. That's, you know, roughly $50 billion plus for fiscal 2026. For AI. I just wanted to make sure I got that right. And then the main question, Hock, is that there is sort of this emerging debate about customer-owned tooling. You know, your async customers potentially wanting to do more things on their own. How do you see your XPU content and share at your largest customer evolve over the next one or two years? Thank you.\nHock Tan: Well, to answer your first question, what we said is correct that as of now, we have $73 billion of backlog in place, account of XPU switches, DSPs, lasers, for AI data centers that we anticipate shipping over the next eighteen months. And obviously, this is as of now. I mean, we fully expect more bookings to come in over that period of time. And so do not take that $73 billion as that's the revenue we ship over the next eighteen months. Just saying we have that now, and then the bookings have been accelerating. And frankly, we see that bookings not just in XPUs, but in switches, DSPs, all the other components that go into AI data centers. We have never seen bookings of the nature that what we have seen over the past three months. Particularly, with respect to Taiwan six switches. This is one of the fastest-growing products in terms of deployment that we have ever seen. Of any switch product that we put out there. It is pretty interesting. And partly because it's the only one of its kind out there at this point. At 102 terabit per second. And that's the exact product needed to expand the clusters of the latest GPU and XPUs out there. No. That's great. But as far as what is the future as XPU is your broader question. My answer to you is do not follow what you hear out there as gospel. It's a trajectory. It's a multiyear journey. And many of the players and not too many players doing LLMs want to do their own custom AI accelerator for very good reasons. You can put in hardware what if you use a general-purpose GPU you can only do in software and kernels in software. You can achieve performance-wise so much better in the custom-purpose design hardware-driven XPU. And we see that in the TPU and we see that in all the accelerators we are doing for other customers. Much much better in areas of sparse call, training, inference, reasoning, all that stuff. Now will that mean that over time, they all want to go do it themselves?\nOperator: Not necessarily.\nHock Tan: And in fact, because the technology in silicon keeps updating, keeps evolving. And if you are an LLM player, where do you put your resources in order to compete in this space? Especially when you have to compete at the end of the day against merchant GPU. Who are not slowing down in their rate of evolution. So I see that as this concept of customer tooling is an overblown hypothesis which frankly I do not think will happen. Thank you.\nOperator: And that will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, thanks for letting me ask a question. Hock, I wanted to go to something you touched on earlier about the TPUs going a little bit more to like a merchant go-to-market to other customers. Do you believe that's the substitution effect for customers who otherwise would have done ASICs with you, or do you think it's actually broadening the market? And so what are kind of the financial implications of that from your perspective?\nHock Tan: That's a very good question, Ross. And what we see right now is the most obvious move it does is it goes to the people who use TPUs. The alternative is GPUs, merchant basis. That's the most common thing that happens. Because to do that substitution for another custom, it's different. To make an investment in a custom accelerator is a multiyear journey. It's a strict directional thing. It's not necessarily a very transactional or short-term move. Moving from GPU to TPU is a transactional move. Going into an AI accelerator of your own is a long-term strategic move and nothing would deter you from there to continue to make that investment towards that end goal of successfully creating and deploying your own custom AI accelerator. So that's the motion we see.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nOperator: And that will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results, guidance, and execution. Hock, again, I just want to sort of verify this. Right? So you talked about total AI backlog of $73 billion over the next six quarters. Right? This is just a snap of your order book, like, right now. But given your lead times, I think customers can and still will place orders for AI in quarters four, five, and six. So as time moves forward, that backlog number for more shipments in '26 will probably still go up. Right? Is that the correct interpretation? And then given the strong and growing backlog, right, the question is does the team have three nanometer, two nanometer wafer supply, COA substrate, HBM supply commitments to support all of the demand in your order book and I know one of the areas where you are trying to mitigate this is in advanced packaging. Right? You're bringing up your Singapore facility. You guys just remind us what part of the advanced packaging process the team is focusing on with the Singapore facility? Thanks.\nHock Tan: Thanks. Well, to answer your first simpler question, you're right. You can say that $73 billion is the backlog we have today. To ship over the next six quarters. You might also say that and given our lead time, we expect more orders to be able to be absorbed into our backlog for shipments over the next six quarters. So take it that we expect revenue a minimum revenue, one way to look at it, of $73 billion over the next six quarters. But we do expect much more as more orders come in. For shipments within the next six quarters. Yeah. Our lead time depending on the particular product it is, can be anywhere from six months to a year. On with respect to supply chain is what you're asking critical supply chain on silicon. Yeah. And packaging. Yeah. That's an interesting challenge that we have been addressing over for constantly and continue to. And with the strength of the demand and the need for more innovative packaging, advanced packaging, because you are talking about multi chips multi multi chips in creating every customer accelerator now. The packaging becomes a very interesting and technical challenge. And building our Singapore fab is to really talk about partially insourcing those advanced packaging. We believe that we have enough demand we can literally insource not from the viewpoint of not just cost, but in the viewpoint of supply chain security and delivery. And we're building up a fairly substantial facility for packaging advanced packaging, Singapore as indicated. Purely for that purpose to address the package advanced packaging site. Silicon wise, now we go back to the same pressure source in Taiwan, TSMC. And so we keep going for more and more capacity in two nanometers, three nanometers, and so far, we do not have that constraint. But again, time will tell as we progress and as our backlog builds up. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask with the original $10 billion deal, you talked about a rack sale. I just wanted to with the follow-on order as well as the fifth customer, can you just maybe describe how you're gonna deliver those? Is it an XPU, or is it a rack? And then maybe you can kinda just walk us through the math and kinda what the deliverable is. Obviously, Google uses its own networking, so I'm kinda curious too. Would it be a copy exactly what Google does? That you could talk to it to name? Or would you have your own networking there as well?\nHock Tan: Thanks. That's a very complicated question, Blayne. Let me tell you what it is. It's a system sale. How about that? It's a real system sale. We have so many components beyond XPUs, customer accelerators, in or any system, in AI system, any AI system, used by hyperscalers that, yeah, we believe it begins to make sense to do it as a system sales and be responsive but be fully responsible for the entire system or rack as you call it. I think people understand it as a system still better. And so on this customer number four, we are selling it as a system with our key components in it. And that's no different than selling a chip. We certify a final ability to run as part of the wholesale selling process.\nOperator: And that will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Wanted to touch on gross margins and maybe it feeds into a little bit of prior question. So I understand why the AI business is somewhat dilutive to gross margins. We have the HPM pass-through. And then presumably with the system sales, that will be more diluted. And you've hinted at this in the past, but I was wondering if you could be a little more explicit. As this AI revenue starts to ramp, as we start to get system sales, how should we be thinking about that gross margin number, say, if we're looking out, you know, four quarters or six quarters, is it low 70s? I mean, could it start with a six at the corporate level? And I guess I'm also wondering I understand how that comes down, but what about the operating margins? Do you think you get enough operating leverage on the OpEx side to keep operating margins flat, or do they need to come down as well?\nHock Tan: I'll let Kirsten give you the details, enough for me to broadly high level explain to you stating good question. Phenomenal. You don't see that impacting us right now, and we have already started that process. Of some system sales. You don't see that in our numbers, but it worked. And we have said that openly. The AI revenue has a lower gross margin than our obviously, the rest of the business, including software, of course. But we expect the rate of growth to offer as we do more and more AI revenue to be so so much that we get the operating leverage on our operating spending that operating margin won't deliver dollars that are still a high level of growth from what it has been. So we expect operating leverage to benefit us at the operating margin level even as gross margin will start to deteriorate. High level.\nKirsten Spears: No. I think Hock said that fairly. And the second half of the year when we do start shipping more systems, the situation is straightforward. We'll be passing through more components that are not ours. So think of it similar to the XPUs where we have memory on those XPUs, we're passing through those costs. We'll be passing through more costs within the rack. And so those gross margins will be lower. However, overall, the way Hock said it, gross margin dollars will go up. Margins will go down. Operating margins, because we have leverage, operating margin dollars will go up, but the margin itself, a percentage of revenues will come down a bit. But we're not I mean, we'll guide closer to you know, the end of the year for that.\nStacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJim Schneider: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Hock, I was wondering if you might care to calibrate your expectations for AI revenue in fiscal 2026 a little bit more closely. I believe you talked about acceleration in fiscal 2026 off of the 65% growth rate you did in fiscal 2025. And then you're guiding to 100% growth for Q1. So I'm just wondering if the Q1 is a good jumping-off point for the growth rate you expect for the full year something maybe a little bit less than that? And then maybe if you could separately clarify whether your $1 billion of orders for the fifth customer is indeed OpenAI, which you made a separate announcement about. Thank you.\nHock Tan: Wow. There's a lot of question here. But let me start off with 2026. You know, our backlog is very dynamic these days. As I said. And it is continuing to ramp up. And you're right. We originally, six months ago said maybe year on year, AI revenues would grow in 2026 sixty, 70%. Q1, we doubled. And Q1 2026, today, we're saying it doubled. And when we're looking at it, because all the fresh orders keep coming in, and we give you a milestone of where we are today. Which is $73 billion of backlog to be shipped over the next eighteen months. And we do fully expect as I answered the earlier question, for that $73 billion over the eighteen months, to keep growing, Now it's a moving target. It's a moving number as we move in time. But it will grow. And it's hard for me to pinpoint what 2026 is going to look like precisely. I rather not give you guys any guidance, and that's why we don't give you guidance. But we do give it for Q1. Give it time or give it till Q2, and you're right. It's saying that to us, is it an accelerating trend? And my answer is it's likely to be an accelerating trend. As we progress through 2026. Hope that answers. Your question.\nJim Schneider: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nBen Reitzes: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks a lot. Hey, Hock. I wanted to ask I I'm not sure if the last caller said something on it, but I didn't hear it in the answer was wanted to ask about the OpenAI contract that it's supposed to start in the second half of the year and go through 2029 for 10 gigawatts. I'm gonna assume that that's the that's the fifth customer order there. And I was just wondering if you're still confident in that being a driver. Are there any obstacles to making that a major driver? And when you expect, you know, that to contribute? And your confidence in it. Thanks so much, Hock.\nHock Tan: You didn't hear that answer from my last caller, Jim's question was because I did not answer it I'm not answering it either. The fifth customer. And he's a real customer and he will grow. They are on their multi-year journey to their own XPUs. And let's leave it at that. As far as the OpenAI view that you have, I we appreciate the fact that it is a multiyear journey. That will run through '29 as our press release with OpenAI showed. 10 gigawatts between '26 to more more like '27, 28. 29. Ben. Not 26. It's more like 27, 28, 29, 10 gigawatts. That was the OpenAI discussion. And that's I call it an agreement, an alignment where we're headed with respect to a various respected and valued customer OpenAI.\nBen Reitzes: But that's real interesting.\nHock Tan: We do not expect March in '26. Ah, okay. That's thanks for clarifying that. That's really interesting. Appreciate it.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nCJ Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Hock, I wanted to talk about custom silicon and maybe speak to how you expect content to grow for broad generation to generation. And as part of that, you know, your competitor announced CPX offering essentially accelerator for an accelerator for massive context windows. I'm curious if you see it a broadening opportunity you know, for your existing five customers to have multiple XPU offerings. Thanks so much.\nHock Tan: Thank you. No. Yeah. It's you hit it right on. I mean, the nice thing about a custom accelerator is you try not to do one size fits all. And do and generationally. Each of these five customers now can create their version of chip of an XPU customer accelerator for training. And inference. And it basically is almost two parallel tracks going on almost simultaneously for each of them. So I would have plenty of versions to deal with. I do not need to create any more version. We got plenty of different content out there. Just on the basis of creating these customer accelerators. And by the way, when you do customer accelerators, you tend to put more hardware in that unique differentiated versus trying to make it work on software. And creating kernels into software. I know that's very tricky too. But think about the difference where you can create in hardware those sparse call data routers. Versus the dense matrix multipliers all in one same chip. And that's one of many one of just one example of what creating customer accelerators is letting us do. Over that matter, a variation in how much memory capacity or memory bandwidth from for the same customer from chip to chip just because even in inference, want to do more reasoning, first decoding, versus something else, like prefilled. So you literally start to create different hardware for different and run your workloads. aspect of how you want to train or inference It's a very fascinating area. And we are seeing a lot of variations and multiple chips. For each of our customers. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nHarsh Kumar: Yeah, Hock and team. First of all, congratulations on some pretty stunning numbers. I've got an easy one and a more strategic one. The easy one is, your guide in AI Hock and Kirsten is calling for almost $1.7 billion of sequential growth. I was curious, maybe you could talk about the diversity of the growth between the three existing customers. Is it pretty well spread out? All of them growing? Or is one sort of driving much of the growth? And then how strategically one of your competitors bought a photonic fabric company recently I was curious about your take on that technology and if you think it's disruptive or you think it's just gimmickry at this point in time.\nHock Tan: I like the way you address this question because the way that you address the question to me is almost hesitant. Thank you. I appreciate that. But on your first part, yeah, we are driving growth and we it began to feel like this thing never ends. And it's a real mixed bag. Of existing customers and on existing XPUs And I'll be part of it as XPUs that we're seeing. And that's not to slow down the fact that as I indicated in my remarks and commented on the demand for switches. Not just among six, not among five. Switches. The demand for our latest 1.6 terabit per second DSPs. That enables optical interconnects for scale out. Particularly? It's just very, very strong. And by extension, demand for the optical components like lasers, pin diodes, just going nuts. All that come together. Now, all that is small dollar, relatively lesser dollars when it comes to XPUs, as you probably guessed. I mean, no. Of this to give you a sense, maybe let me look at it on a backlog side. Of the $73 billion or AI revenue backlog over the next eighteen months, I talked about maybe $20 billion of it is everything else. The rest, is XPUs. Hope that gives you a sense for what the mix is. That's not to say that the rest is still $20 billion. That's not small. By any means. So we value that. So when you talk about your next question of silicon photonics, and as a means to create basically much better, more efficient, lower power interconnects in not just scale out, but hopefully scale up Yeah. I could see a point in time in the future when silicon photonics methods as the only way to do it. We're not quite there yet. But we have the technology and we continue to develop the technology even as each time we develop it first for 400 gigabit then we going on to nine 800 gigabit bandwidth Not ready for it yet. So and even we have the product, and we're now doing it for 1.6 terabit bandwidth to create silicon photonics switches silicon photonics interconnects Not even sure it will get fully deployed because you know, engineers, our engineers, our peer, and the peers we have out there, was somehow trying to find a way to still do try to do scale up within a rack in copper as long as possible. And in scale up in no pluggable optics. The final final straw is when you can't do it well in pluggable optics. Of course, when you can't do it even in copper, then you're right. You go to silicon photonics. And it will happen. And we're ready for it. Just saying, not anytime soon.\nHarsh Kumar: Thank you, Hock.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Carl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\nCarl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you. Could you speak to the supply chain resiliency and visibility you have with your key material suppliers, particularly co-ops as you not only support your existing customer programs, but the two new custom compute processors that you announced since your quarter. I guess what I can get at is you also happen to address the very large subset of networking and compute AI supply chains. You've talked about record backlog. If you were to pin some of the bottlenecks that you have, the areas that you're aiming to address and mitigate from supply chain bottlenecks, what would they be and how do you see that ameliorating into '26? Thank you.\nHock Tan: It's across the board. Typically. I mean, it's we are very fortunate in some ways that we have the product technology and the operating business lines. To create multiple key leading-edge components that enable today's state-of-the-art AI data centers. I mean, our DSP as I said earlier, is now at 1.6 terabits per second. That's the leading edge. Connectivity for bandwidth for this for the top of the top of the heap, XPU, and even GPU. And we intend to be that way. And we have the lasers EMLs, VCSELs, CWL lasers that go with it. So it's fortunate that we have all this. And the key comp active components that go with it and we see it very quick early, and we expand the capacity as we do the design to match it. And along this is the long answer to what I'm trying to get at, which is I think we are of any of any of this data center suppliers of the system racks not counting the power the power shell and all that. Now that's hard to get beyond us. On the PowerShell and the transformers and the gas turbines. If you just look at the rack, the systems on AI, we probably have a good handle on where the bottlenecks are because sometimes we are part of the bottlenecks. Which we then want to get rid to resolve. So we feel pretty good about that. Through 2026.\nCarl Ackerman: Thank you.\nHock Tan: One moment for our next question.\nOperator: That will come from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nChristopher Rolland: Hi, thanks for the question. Just first a clarification and then my question. And sorry to come back to this issue, but if I understand you correctly, Hock, I think you were saying that OpenAI would be a general agreement so it's not binding maybe similar to the agreements with both NVIDIA and AMD. And then secondly, you talked about flat non-AI semiconductor revenue Maybe what's going on there? Is there still an inventory overhang in and what could what what do we need to get that going again? Do you see growth, eventually, eventually in that business? Thank you.\nHock Tan: Well, on the non-AI semiconductor, we see broadband literally recovering very well. And we do not see the others No. We see stability. We do not see a sharp recovery that is sustainable yet. So I guess given a one a couple more quarters, but we do not see any further deterioration in demand. And it's more I think maybe the ops and AI is sucking the ops oxygen a lot out of enterprise spending elsewhere. And hyperscaler spending elsewhere. We do not see it getting any worse. We do not see it recovering very quickly. With the exception of broadband. That's a simple summary of non-AI. With respect to OpenAI now before diving into the I'm just telling you what that 10 gigawatt announcement is all about. Separately, the journey with them on the customer accelerated progresses at a very advanced stage and will happen very, very quickly. And it's and we will have a committed element to this whole thing. And I won't. But what we I was articulating earlier was the 10 gigawatt announcement. And that 10 gigawatt announcement is an agreement to be aligned on developing 10 gigawatts for OpenAI over 27 to 29 time frame. I said, that's different from the XPU program we're developing with them.\nChristopher Rolland: I see. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And we do have time for one final question, and that will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you very much. So if you have $21 billion of rack revenue in 2026, I guess, do we stay at that run rate beyond that? Are you gonna continue to sell racks, or does that sort of that type of business make shift over time? And I'm really just trying to figure out the percentage of your eighteen-month backlog that's actually full systems at this point.\nHock Tan: Well, it's an interesting question. And while that question basically comes to how much compute capacity is needed by our customers over the next as I say, over the period beyond eighteen months. And your guess is probably as good as mine based on what we all know out there. Which is really what it relates to. But if they need more, then you see that continuing even larger. If they do not need it, then probably it won't. But so one is what we're trying to indicate is that the demand we are seeing over that period of time right now.\nOperator: Thank you.

Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I will now turn the call over to Hock.\nHock Tan: Thank you, Ji. And thank you everyone for joining us today. In our fiscal Q3 2025, total revenue was a record $16 billion, up 22% year on year. Now revenue growth was driven by better than expected strength in AI semiconductors, and our continued growth in VMware. Q3 consolidated adjusted EBITDA was a record $10.7 billion, up 30% year on year. Now, looking beyond what we are just reporting this quarter, with robust demand from AI bookings, were extremely strong. And our current consolidated backlog for the company hit a record of $110 billion. Q3 semiconductor revenue was $9.2 billion as year on year growth accelerated to 26% year on year. And this accelerated growth was driven by AI Semiconductor revenue of $5.2 billion, which was up 63% year on year and extend the trajectory of robust growth to 10 consecutive quarters. Now let me give you more color on our XPU business, which accelerated to 65% of our AI revenue this quarter. Demand for custom AI accelerators from our three customers continued to grow as each of them journeys at their own pace towards compute self-sufficiency. And progressively, we continue to gain share with these customers. Now, further to these three customers, as we have previously mentioned, we have been working with other prospects on their own AI accelerators. Last quarter, one of these prospects released production orders to Broadcom. And we have accordingly characterized them as a qualified customer for XPUs. And in fact, has secured over $10 billion of orders of AI regs based on our XPUs. And reflecting this, we now expect the outlook for fiscal 2026 AI revenue to improve significantly from what we had indicated last quarter. Turning to AI networking. Demand continued to be strong. Because networking is becoming critical as LLMs continue to evolve in intelligence and compute classes have to grow bigger. The network is the computer. And our customers are facing challenges as they scale to clusters beyond 100,000 compute nodes. For instance, scale up which we all know about, is a difficult challenge. When you are trying to create substantial bandwidth to share memory across multiple GPUs or XPUs with the direct Today's AI rank scales up a mere 72 GPUs at 28.8 terabit per second bandwidth using a proprietary NVLink. On the other hand, earlier this year, we have launched Tomahawk five We've opened AI we've opened Ethernet. Sorry. Which can scale up 512 compute nodes for customers using XPUs. Moving on to scaling out across regs. Today, the current architecture using 51.2 terabit per second requires three tiers of networking switches. In June, we launched Tomahawk six and our Ethernet based 102 terabit per second switch which flattens the network. To two tiers. Resulting in lower latency much less power. And when you scale to clusters beyond single data center footprint, You now need to scale computing across data centers. And over the past two years, we have deployed our Jericho three Ethernet router with hyperscale customers to just do this. And today, we have launched our next generation Jericho four. Ethernet fabric router with 51.2 terabit per second deep buffering intelligence intelligent congestion control, to handle classes beyond 200,000 compute nodes crossing multiple data centers. We know the biggest challenge to deploying larger clusters of compute for generative AI will be in networking. And for the past twenty years, Broadcom has developed for Ethernet, networking is entirely applicable to the challenges of scale up, scale out, and scale across in generative AI. And turning to our forecast as I mentioned earlier, we continue to make steady progress in growing our AI revenue. For Q4, 2025, we forecast AI semiconductor revenue to be approximately $6.2 billion, up 66% year on year. Now, turning to non AI semiconductors. Demand continues to be slow to recover. In Q3 revenue of $4 billion was flat sequentially. While broadband showed strong sequential growth, Enterprise networking and service storage were down sequentially. Wireless and industrial were flat quarter on quarter as we expect. In contrast, in Q4, driven by seasonality, we forecast non AI semiconductor revenue to grow low double digits sequentially to approximately $4.6 billion. Broadband, server storage and wireless are expected to improve. While enterprise networking remains down quarter on quarter. Now let me talk about our infrastructure software segment. Q3 Infrastructure Software revenue of $6.8 billion was 17% year on year. Above our outlook of $6.7 billion as bookings continue to be strong during the quarter. We booked in fact total contract value over $8.4 billion during Q3. But here's one I'm most excited about. After two years of engineering development by over 5,000 developers. We deliver on a promise. When we acquired VMware. We release VMware Cloud Foundation version nine dot zero a fully integrated cloud platform which can be deployed by enterprise customers on prem or carry to the cloud. It enables enterprises to run any application workload including AI workloads, on virtual machines and on modern containers. These provides the real alternative to public club. In Q4, we expect Infrastructure and Software revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, up 15% year on year. And in summary, continued strength in AI and VMware would drive our guidance for Q4 consolidated revenue to approximately $17.4 billion, up 24% year on year. And we expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be 67% of revenue. And with that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\nKirsten Spears: Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q3 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was a record $16 billion for the quarter, up 22% from a year ago. Gross margin was 78.4% of revenue in the quarter, better than we originally guided on higher software revenues and product mix within semiconductors. Consolidated operating expenses were $2 billion of which $1.5 billion was research and development. Q3 operating income was a record $10.5 billion, up 32% from a year ago. On a sequential basis, even as gross margin was down 100 basis points on revenue mix, operating margin increased 20 basis points sequentially to 65.5% on operating leverage. Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7 billion or 67% of revenue was above our guidance of 66%. This figure excludes a $142 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P and L for our two segments. Starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $9.2 billion with growth accelerating to 26% year on year driven by AI. Semiconductor revenue represented 57% of total revenue in the quarter. Gross margin for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was approximately 67% down 30 basis points year on year on product mix. Operating expenses increased 9% year on year to $951 million on increased investment in R and D for leading edge AI semiconductors. Semiconductor operating margin of 57% was up 130 basis points year on year and flat sequentially. Now moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software of $6.8 billion was up 17% year on year and represented 43% of revenue. Gross margin for infrastructure software 93% in the quarter compared to 90% a year ago. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of approximately 77%. This compares to operating margin of 67% a year ago reflecting the completion of the integration of VMware. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $7 billion and represented 44% of revenue. We spent $142 million on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were thirty seven days in the third quarter compared to thirty two days a year ago. We ended the third quarter with inventory of $2.2 billion up 8% sequentially in anticipation of revenue growth next quarter. Our days of inventory on hand were sixty six days in Q3, compared to sixty nine days in Q2 as we continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the third quarter with $10.7 billion of cash and $66.3 billion of gross principal debt. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $65.8 billion in fixed rate debt is 3.9% and 6.9 years, respectively. The weighted average interest rate and years to maturity of our $500 million at floating rate debt is 4.7% and 0.2 years, respectively. Turning to capital allocation. Q3, we paid stockholders $2.8 billion of cash dividends, based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.59 per share. We expect the non GAAP diluted share count to be In Q4, approximately 4.97 billion shares, excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases. Now moving to guidance. Our guidance for Q4 is for consolidated revenue of $17.4 billion up 24% year on year. We forecast semiconductor revenue of approximately $10.7 billion up 30% year on year. Within this, we expect Q4 AI semiconductor revenue of $6.2 billion up 66% year on year. We expect infrastructure software revenue of approximately $6.7 billion up 15% year on year. For your modeling purposes, we expect Q4 consolidated gross margin to be down approximately 70 basis points sequentially primarily reflecting a higher mix of XPUs and also wireless revenue. As a reminder, consolidated gross margins through the year will be impacted by the revenue mix of infrastructure software and product mix within semiconductors. We expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be 67%. We expect the non GAAP tax rate for Q4 and fiscal year 2025 to remain at 14%. I will now pass the call back to Hock for some more exciting news.\nHock Tan: I don't know about exciting, Kirsten, but I do. I thought before we move to questions, I should share an update. The board and I have agreed that I will continue as the CEO of Broadcom through 2030 at least. These are exciting times for Broadcom, and I'm very enthusiastic to continue to drive value for our shareholders. Operator, please open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Star one one again. Due to time restraints, we ask that you please limit And our first question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for asking question. Hock, thank you for sticking around for a few more years. So I just wanted to talk about the AI business and, specifically, the XPU. When you said you're gonna grow significantly faster than what you had thought, a quarter ago, what's changed? Is it just the impressive prospect moving to a customer definition, so that $10 billion backlog that you mentioned? Or is it, stronger demand across the existing three customers? Any detail on that will be helpful.\nHock Tan: I think it's both, Ross. But to a large extent, it's the fourth quarter customer that we now add on to our roster. Which we will ship pretty strongly in 2026, I should say. So combination of increasing the volumes from existing three customers and we moved through that very progressively and steadily. And the addition of a fourth customer with immediate and fairly substantial demand. Really put our really, changes our thinking of what '26 would be starting to look like. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nHarlan Sur: Hi. Good afternoon. Congratulations on a well executed quarter and strong free cash flow. Know everybody's gonna ask a lot of questions on AI, Hock. I'm gonna ask about the non AI simulators If I look at your guidance for Q4, it looks like the non AI streaming business is gonna be down about 78% year over year on fiscal twenty five if you hit the midpoint of the Q4 guidance. Good news, is that the negative year over year trends have been improving to the year, in fact, think you guys are gonna be positive year over year in the fourth quarter. You've characterized it as relatively close to the cyclical bottom, relatively slow to recover. However, we have seen some green shoots of positivity. Right? Broadband server storage, enterprise networking. You're still driving the DOCSIS four upgrade in broadband, cable, You've got next gen PON upgrades in China and The US in front of you. Enterprise spending on network upgrades is accelerating. So near term, from the cyclical bottom, how should we think about the magnitude of the cyclical upturn? And given your thirty to forty week lead times, are you seeing continued order improvements in the non AI segment, which would point you to continued cyclical recovery into next fiscal year?\nHock Tan: Well, you know, then if you take a look at that non AI segment, I mean, you're right. From a year on year Q4 guidance, we are actually up, as you say, slightly. Couple one or 2% from a year ago. And it's not much really to shout about at this point. And the and the big issue is the puts and takes. And the puts and takes and the bottom line to all this is other than seasonality that we perceive if you look at it short term, we've all looking year on year, but looking sequentially. We see in things like wireless and we even start to see some seasonality in server storage these days. We don't kind of all washes out so far. The only consistent trend we've seen over the last three quarters that is moving up strongly is broadband. And nothing else if you look at it from a cyclical point of view, seems to be able to sustain an uptrend so far. I don't think it's getting but as a whole, they are not getting worse as you pointed out, Harlan. But they are not showing a v shaped recovery as a whole. That we would like to see to see and expect to see in in cyclical semiconductor cycles. The only thing that gives us some hope is broadband at this point. And it is recovering very strongly. But then it was the business that was most impacted in the in the sharp downturn of '24 and early twenty five. So again, one takes that with a grain of salt. But best answer to you for you is non non AI semiconductor is kind of slow to recover as I said. And Q4 year on year is up maybe low single digits. Is the best way to to describe it at this point. So I'm expecting to see more of a u shaped recovery in non AI. And perhaps by late twenties mid twenty six, late twenty six, we'll start to see some meaningful recovery. But as of right now, not clear.\nHarlan Sur: Mhmm. Are are you starting to see that in your order trend in your order book just because your lead times are, like, forty weeks. Right?\nHock Tan: We are. But we've been tricked before. But we are. The bookings are up, and they are up year on year in excess of 20%. Nothing like what AI bookings look like. But 23% is still pretty good. Right?\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question and best wishes for the next part of your tenure. My question is on know, if you could help us quantify what is the new fiscal twenty six AI guidance. Because I think the last call you mentioned '26 could grow at the 60% growth rate. So what is the updated number? Is it, you know, 60% plus the the $10 billion that you mentioned? And sort of related to that, do you expect the custom versus networking mix to stay broadly what it has been this past year or or evolve more towards customs? So any quantification on this, you know, networking versus custom mix would be very helpful. Fiscal twenty six. Okay. Let's answer the first part first. If I could be so bold as to suggest to you when I last quarter when I said, hey, the trend of growth of '26 will mirror that of '25. Which is 50, 60%. Year on year. That's really all I say. I didn't quote a ban. Of course, it comes out 50, percent because that's what '25 is. All I'm saying you want to put another way of it, looking at what I'm saying, which is perhaps more accurate, we're seeing the growth rate accelerate. As opposed to just remain steady at that 50, 60% We are expecting and seeing 2026 to accelerate more than the growth rate we see in '25. And I know you love me to throw in a number at you, but you know what? We're not supposed to be giving you a forecast for '26, but best way to describe it, it will be fairly material improvement. And the networking versus custom? Ah, good point. Thanks for reminding me. As we see it and a big part of this driver of growth will be experience. And as a to and the reason of repeating what I said in my remarks, comes from the fact that we are continue to gain share at our three original customers They have to they're on their journey, and each passing generation they go more to XPUs. So we are gaining share from this three. We now have the benefit of an additional four four significant customer. I would just say fourth and very significant customer. And that combination will mean more XPUs. And as I said, as the ratio as the as we create more and more experience among four guys, the networking we get the networking with these four guys, but now the mix of networking from outside these four guys will now be a smaller be diluted, be a smaller share. So I expect actually networking percentage of the pool to be a declining percentage. Going into twenty six.\nOperator: Thank you, And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Was wondering if you could help me parse out this $110 billion backlog. Did I that number right? Could you give us some color on on on the makeup of it? Like, how far out does that go and, like, how much of that $110 billion is AI versus non AI versus software?\nHock Tan: Well, I guess, Stacy, we generally don't break up backlog. I've just given a total number to give you a sense of how strong the business is as a whole for the company. And it's largely driven by AI, as a grow in terms of growth. Software continue to add on a steady basis and non AI as as I indicated, has grown double digits. Nothing compared to AI which has grown very strongly. Mhmm. Give you a sense, perhaps, fully 50% of it at least, is semiconductors.\nStacy Rasgon: Okay. And it's fair to say that of that semiconductor piece, it's gonna be much more AI than non AI?\nHock Tan: Right.\nStacy Rasgon: Yeah. Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Hock, congrats on able to guide to the AI revenue well above 60%. For next year. So I wanted to be a little greedy and ask you about maybe 27 and the other three customers or so. How is the dialogue going beyond these four customers? In the past, you've talked about having seven. Now we've added a fourth to production. And then there were three. Are are you hearing from others? And how's the trend going with maybe with the other three maybe beyond the 26 into 27 and beyond? How's that momentum you think going to shape up? Thanks so much.\nHock Tan: Ben, you are definitely greedy and definitely overthinking this for me. Thank you. But yeah. You know, that's if asking for qualify, subjective qualification. And, frankly, I I don't wanna give that. I'm not comfortable giving that because sometimes we stumble into production in fairly in time frames that are fairly unexpected surprisingly. Equally, it could get delayed. So I rather not give you any more color on prospects than just tell you these prospects are real prospects and continue to be very closely engaged towards developing each of their own experience with every intent of going into substantial production. Like the four we have today who are custom.\nBen Reitzes: Yeah. You still think that that that million units by, you know, goal for these seven though, is still intact.\nHock Tan: For the oh, for the three, I said. Now they are four. That's silly. Only for the for the prospects, no comment. I'm not positioned to judge on that. But for our four three, four customers now, yes.\nBen Reitzes: Alright. Thanks a lot. Congrats.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJim Schneider: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Hock, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color not necessarily on the prospects, which you still have in the pipeline, but how you view the universe of additional prospects beyond the seven you know, customers and prospects you've already identified. Do you still see there being additional prospects that would be worthy of a of a custom chip. And I know you've been relatively know, circumspect in terms of the the number of customers that are out there and the volume that they can provide and and selective in terms of the opportunities you're interested in. So maybe frame for us the additional prospects as you see them beyond the v seven. Thank you.\nHock Tan: That's a very good question. And let me let me answer it in a fairly broader basis. Well, as I said before and perhaps said repeat a bit more. We're very send in we look at this market into broad segments. You know, that's one is simply the guys, the parties, the customers, who develop their own LLM. And the rest of the other market I consider is collectively lump as enterprise. That is markers that run that will run AI workloads for enterprise. Whether it's on prem or GPU XPU or whatever as a service. The enterprise. We don't address that market, to be honest. We That's because that's that's a hard market for us to address. And we're not set up to address that. We instead address this LLM market and as I said many times before, it's a very few narrow markets. Few players driving frontier models on a consistent on a very accelerated trend towards super intelligence for one plagiarizing the term of someone else, but you know what I mean. And the other guys who would invest, who need to invest a lot initially, my view on training. Training of ever larger and larger clusters of ever more capable accelerators but also as for these guys, you know, they got to be accountable to shareholders or accountable to being able to create cash flows that can sustain their path they start to also invest in inference in a massive way to monetize their models. These are the players we work with. These are individually people or players who spend a lot of money on on a lot of compute capacity just that there are only so few of them. And right we have I have indicated, identified seven. Four of which now our customers Three continues to be prospects we engage with. And we're very picky and still careful. I should say, Shenandoah, picky. Careful. Who qualifies under that. And I indicated it. They have a they are building a platform or have a platform and I'm investing very much on leading LLMs models. And we're severed and I think that's about it. We may get see one more perhaps as a prospect But again, we are very thoughtful and careful about even making that qualification. But right now, for sure, we have seven. And that's for now, it's pretty much what we have.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTom O'Malley: Congrats on the really good results. I wanted to ask on Jericho four commentary. NVIDIA talked about the XGET switch and now is talking about scale across. You're talking about Jericho four. It sounds like this market is really starting to develop. Maybe you could talk about when you see material uplift in revenue there and why it's important to start thinking about those type of switches as we move more towards inferencing. Thank you, Hock.\nHock Tan: Great. Well, thank you for picking that up. Yes. Scale across is a new term now. Right? Drawn in. They scale up, which is within the rack you know, within the which computing within the rack. Scale out doing across racks but within the data center. But now when you get to clusters, that are I'm not 100% sure where the cutoff is, but say above a 100,000 GPU or XPUs. That's you're talking about probably many cases in because of limitation of PowerShell. That the data send that you don't do one single data center footprint site. To hand to sit with over a 100,000 of those XPUs in one site. Power may not be easily available. Land may not be. It's cumbersome. So many some outcome is most of all our customers now we see create multiple data center sites close at hand not far away, within range 100 kilometers. It's kind of the level. But be able to then put in homogenous XPUs or GPUs in this multiple location three or four, and network across them so that they behave like in fact, a single cluster. That's the coolest part. And that technology which requires because of distance, deep buffering, very intelligent congestion control. It's technology that exist for many many years in the likes of the telcos of AT and T and Verizon doing network routing. Except this is for even somewhat more trickier workloads, but the same. And we've been shipping that to a couple of hyperscalers over the last two years. As Jericho three. As the scale of these clusters and the bandwidth required for AI training expense, We now launched this Jericho four fifty one terabit per second to handle more bandwidth, but same technology we have tested, proven for the last ten, twenty years. Nothing new. Don't need to create something new for that. It's running in Ethernet. And very proven, very stable, and as I said, last two years under Jericho three, which runs 256 connections, and no compute nodes. We've been selling to a couple of our hyperscale customers.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Carl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Your line is open.\nCarl Ackerman: Hock, have you completely converted your top 10,000 accounts from vSphere to the entire vSphere Cloud Foundation virtualization stack. I asked because I think last quarter, 87% of accounts had adopted that. And that's certainly a marked increase versus less than 10%. For those customers who bought the entire suite before the deal, And I guess as you address that, what interest level are you seeing with the longer tail of enterprise customers adopting BCF? And are you seeing tangible cross selling benefits of your merchant semiconductor storage and networking business as those customers adopt VMware. Thank you.\nHock Tan: Okay. To answer your first part of the question, yeah, pretty much virtually way over 90% is is bought VCF. Now like to I am careful about choice of what. Because we have sold them on it, and they bought licenses to deploy doesn't mean they are fully deployed. Here comes the other part of our work, which is to take this 10,000 customers or big chunk of them who have taken who have bought the vision of a private cloud on prem and working with them to enable them to deploy and operate it successfully on their infrastructure on prem. That's the net the hard work over the next two years that we see happening. And as we do it, we see expansion across their foot IT footprint on VCF private cloud. Running on the dataset in within their data center. That's the key part of it. And we see that continuing. And that's the second phase of my VMware story. First phase is convince these people to convert from perpetual subscription so doing purchase VCF. Second phase now, is make that purchase they made on VCF very create the value they look for in private cloud on their premise, on their IT data center. That's what's happening. And then and that will sustain for quite a while because on top of that, we will start selling advanced services, security, disaster recovery, even AI running AI workloads on it. All that is very exciting. Your second question is, is that able to let me enable me to sell more hardware No. Why it's quite independent? In fact, as they virtualize their data centers, we consciously accept the fact that we are commoditizing the underlying hardware in the data center. Commoditizing servers, commoditizing storage, commoditizing even networking. And that's fine. And by so commoditizing, we're actually reducing cost of investments in hardware in a in data centers for enterprises. Now beyond the largest largest 10,000 are we seeing a lot of success? We're seeing some. But again, two reasons why we do not expect it to be as necessary successful. One is the you know, the the value the TCO as they call it, that comes from it will be much less. But the more important thing is the skill sets that needs to not just deploy that you can get. Services and ourselves to help them, but to keep operating might not be something that they can take on. And we shall see. This is a area this is an area we're still learning. And be interesting to see. Well, VMware has 300,000 customers. We see the top 10,000 as making a for as being people it makes a lot of sense, derive a lot of value, in deploying private cloud using VCF. We now are looking at whether the next 20, 30,000 midsized companies see the same way. Stay tuned. I'll let you know.\nCarl Ackerman: Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nCJ Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to focus on gross margins I understand that the guide down 70 bps, particularly with software lower sequentially. And greater contributions from wireless and XPU. But to to hit that 77 spot seven, I either have to model semiconductor margins flat, which I would think would be lower, or software gross margins to 95% you know, up 200 bps. So can you kinda help me under better understand kind of the moving parts there? To to allow only a 70 bit drop\nKirsten Spears: Yeah. I mean, the TPUs will be going up along with wireless. As I said on the call. And our software revenue will be, coming up just a bit as well.\nCJ Muse: You mean XPUs? XPUs. Yes.\nKirsten Spears: And one moment. I was is typically our our our heaviest quarter, right, of the year for wireless. So you have wireless in TPUs with generally lower margins. Right? And then our software revenue coming up.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. In terms of the fourth customer, I think you've talked in the past about potential customers four and five were more hyperscale. And six and seven were more like, you know, the LLM makers themselves. Can you give us a sense for if you could help us categorize that? If not, that's fine. And then the $10 billion of orders, can you give us a time frame on that? Thank you.\nHock Tan: Okay. Yeah. No. It's towards the end of the day, all seven do LLMs Not all of them have a current have a has a huge platform we're talking about. But one could imagine eventually, all of them will have or create a platform. So it's hard to differentiate the two. But coming back coming on the second and third and the delivery of the $10 billion, I'll probably be in around, I would say, the second half of our fiscal quarter year 2026. I would say, to be more even more precise, likely to be Q3 of our fiscal twenty six.\nJoe Moore: Okay. Okay. Q3, it starts or Q3 like, how what time frame does it take to deploy $10 billion? Starts and ends in Q3.\nHock Tan: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Joshua Buchhalter with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJoshua Buchhalter: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the results. I was hoping you could provide some comments on momentum for your first scale up Ethernet and how it compares with, you know, UA link and PCIe solutions out there. You know, how big of a how meaningful is it to have the Tomahawk Altros product out there with a lower latency? And, know, how meaningful do you think scale up Ethernet opportunity could be over the next year as we think about your AI networking business? Thank you.\nHock Tan: Well, that's a good question. And we we ourselves are thinking about that too because to begin with, Ethernet our Ethernet solutions are very disaggregated from the AI's accelerators Anybody does. It's separate. We treat them as separate. Even though you're right, the network is a computer. We have always believed that Ethernet is open source. Anybody should be able to have choices we keep it separate from my XPU. And but the truth of the matter is for our customers, who use the XPU, we develop and we optimize our networking switches and other components that relate to being able to network signals in the in any classes hand in hand with it. In fact, all these XPUs have developed with interface that handles Ethernet. Very, very much so. So that's in a way, we've XPUs with our customers, we are openly enabling. Ethernet as a as a networking protocol of choice. Very, very openly. And it need not be our Ethernet switches. It could be any other, but somebody else Ethernet switches that does it. It just happens to be when the lead in this business so we get that. But beyond it, especially when it comes to a closed system of GPUs, we see less of it. Except in the hyperscalers. Where the hyperscalers are able to architect the GPUs clusters very separate from the networking side, especially in scale scale out. In which case, on those hyperscalers, we sell a lot a lot of these Ethernet switches that does scaling out. And we suspect when it goes to scaling across now, even more Ethernet that are desegregated from the GPUs that are in the in the place. As far as the XPUs are concerned, for sure, it's all Ethernet.\nJoshua Buchhalter: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nChristopher Rolland: Thank you for the question and congrats on the contract extension, Hock. So, yeah, my my my questions are about competition. Both on the networking side and the ASIC side. You kinda answered some of that, I think, in the last question. But do you view any competition on the ASIC side, particularly from US or Asian vendors, or do you think the is decreasing? And on the networking side, do you think UA link or PCIe even has a chance of displacing Sue in 2027 when it's expected to ramp. Thanks.\nHock Tan: Thank you for embracing Sue. Thank you. I didn't expect that to come out. And I appreciate that. Well, you know I'm biased, to be honest. But it's so obvious I can't help but being biased. Because Ethernet is well proven. Ethernet is so known to the engineers, the architects that sits in all these hyperscalers. Developing, designing AI data center, data AI infrastructure. It's the logical thing for them to use. And they are using it. And they are focusing on it. And the development of separate individualized protocol, frankly, You know, it's beyond my imagination why they bother. Ethernet is there. It's been well used. It's proven. It can keep going up. The only thing people talk about is perhaps latency. Especially in scaling up. Hence, the the the emergence of NVLink. And even then, as I indicated, it's not hard for us, and we are not the only one who can who can do that. Quite a few others in Ethernet can do it in the switches. You can just tweak the switches to make the latency super good. Better than NVLink, better than InfiniBand. Less than 250, you know, nanoseconds. Easily. And that's what we did. So it's not that hard. And perhaps this is why I say that because we we have been doing it as the in as the Ethernet has been around the last twenty five years at length. So it's there that they know there's no need to go and create some cook up protocols that now you have to bring people around. Ethernet is the way to go and we and there's plenty of competition too because it's an open source system. So I think Ethernet is way to go and for sure in developing x XPUs for our customers, all these experience with the agreement of customers are made compatible interface with Ethernet. And not some fancy other interface that one has to keep going as bandwidth increase. And we and and I assure you, we have competition, which is one of the why the hyper scalars like the net. It's not just us. They can find somebody else if for whatever reason they don't like us, and we're open to that. It's always good to do that. It's an open source system and lock and there are players in that market. Not any core system. Switching on to XPU competition, Yeah. You you hear about we hear about competition and all that. It's just that it's it's a competition that's it's an area that we always see competition and our only way to secure a position is we try to out invest and now innovate anybody else in this game. We have been fortunate to be the first one creating this XPU model of a six. On silicon. And we also have been fortunate to be probably one of the largest IP developers of semiconductor out there. Things like serializer, deserializer, SerDes been able to develop the best packaging been able to do redesign things that are very low power. So just have to keep investing in it, which we do. To outrun the the competition in this space. And I believe we're doing a fairly decent job of doing it at this point.\nChristopher Rolland: Very clear. Thanks, Hock. Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And we do have time for one last question. And that will come from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nHarsh Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Hock, congratulations on all the exciting AI metrics, and thanks for everything you do for Broadcom and sticking around. Mark, my question is, you've got three to four existing customers that are ramping. As the data centers for AI clusters get bigger and bigger, it makes sense to have differentiation, efficiency, etcetera. Therefore, the case for XPUs why should I not think that your XPU share at these three or four customers that that are existing will be bigger than the GPU share in the longer term. It will be. It's a logical conclusion. Yeah. As you're correct. And we are seeing that step by step. As I say, it's a journey It's a multiyear journey because it's multigenerational. Because this experience don't stay still either. I'm doing multiple versions least two versions, two generation version for each of these customers we have. And with each newer generation, they increase the consumption, the usage of the XPU as they gain confidence, as the model improves, they deploy it even more. So that's the logical trend that XPUs will keep in this few customers of ours, whereas they are successfully deployed and their software stabilizes the software stack, the libraries that sits on these chips stabilizes and proves itself out. They'll get they'll have the confidence to keep using a higher and higher percentage of their compute footprint in their own XPUs. For sure. And we see that And that's why I say we progressively gain share.\nHarsh Kumar: Thank you, Hock.\nOperator: Thank you.

A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I will now turn the call over to Hock.\nHock E. Tan: Thank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q2 2025, total revenue was a record $15 billion, up 20% year-on-year. This 20% year-on-year growth was all organic as Q2 last year was the first full quarter with VMware. Now revenue was driven by continued strength in AI semiconductors and the momentum we have achieved in VMware. Now reflecting excellent operating leverage, Q2 consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $10 billion, up 35% year-on-year. Now let me provide more color. Q2 semiconductor revenue was $8.4 billion, with growth accelerating to 17% year-on-year, up from 11% in Q1. And of course, driving this growth was AI semiconductor revenue of over $4.4 billion, which is up 46% year-on-year and continues the trajectory of 9 consecutive quarters of strong growth. Within this, custom AI accelerators grew double digits year-on-year, while AI networking grew over 170% year-on-year. AI networking, which is based on Ethernet was robust and represented 40% of our AI revenue. As a standard-based open protocol, Ethernet enables one single fabric for both scale out and scale up and remains the preferred choice by our hyperscale customers. Our networking portfolio of Tomahawk switches, Jericho routers and NICs is what's driving our success within AI clusters in hyperscalers. And the momentum continues with our breakthrough Tomahawk 6 switch just announced this week. This represents the next- generation 102.4 terabits per second switch capacity. Tomahawk 6 enables clusters of more than 100,000 AI accelerators to be deployed in just 2 tiers instead of 3. This flattening of the AI cluster is huge because it enables much better performance in training next-generation frontier models through a lower latency, higher bandwidth and lower power. Turning to XPUs or custom accelerators. We continue to make excellent progress on the multiyear journey of enabling our 3 customers and 4 prospects to deploy custom AI accelerators. As we had articulated over 6 months ago, we eventually expect at least 3 customers to each deploy 1 million AI accelerated clusters in 2027, largely for training their frontier models. And we forecast and continue to do so a significant percentage of these deployments to be custom XPUs. These partners are still unwavering in their plan to invest despite the certain economic environment. In fact, what we've seen recently is that they are doubling down on inference in order to monetize their platforms. And reflecting this, we may actually see an acceleration of XPU demand into the back half of 2026 to meet urgent demand for inference on top of the demand we have indicated from training. And accordingly, we do anticipate now our fiscal 2025 growth rate of AI semiconductor revenue to sustain into fiscal 2026. Turning to our Q3 outlook. As we continue our current trajectory of growth, we forecast AI semiconductor revenue to be $5.1 billion, up 60% year-on-year, which would be the 10th consecutive quarter of growth. Now turning to non-AI semiconductors in Q2. Revenue of $4 billion was down 5% year-on-year. Non-AI semiconductor revenue is close to the bottom, has been relatively slow to recover, but they had bright spots. In Q2, broadband, enterprise networking and server storage revenues were up sequentially. However, industrial was down and as expected, wireless was also down due to seasonality. In Q3, we expect enterprise networking and broadband to continue to grow sequentially, but server storage, wireless and industrial are expected to be largely flat. And overall, we forecast non-AI semiconductor revenue to stay around $4 billion. Now let me talk about our infrastructure software segment. Q2 infrastructure software revenue of $6.6 billion was up 25% year-on-year, above our outlook of $6.5 billion. As we have said before, this growth reflects our success in converting our enterprise customers from perpetual vSphere to the full VCF software stack subscription. Customers are increasingly turning to VCF to create a modernized private cloud on-prem, which will enable them to repatriate workloads from public clouds while being able to run modern container-based applications and AI applications. Of our 10,000 largest customers, over 87% have now adopted VCF. The momentum from strong VCF sales over the past 18 months since the acquisition of VMware has created annual recurring revenue or otherwise known as ARR growth of double digits in our core infrastructure software. In Q3, we expect infrastructure software revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, up 16% year-on-year. So in total, we are guiding Q3 consolidated revenue to be approximately $15.8 billion, up 21% year-on-year. We expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be at least 66%. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\nKirsten M. Spears: Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q2 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was a record $15 billion for the quarter, up 20% from a year ago. Gross margin was 79.4% of revenue in the quarter, better than we originally guided on product mix. Consolidated operating expenses were $2.1 billion, of which $1.5 billion was related to R&D. Q2 operating income of $9.8 billion was up 37% from a year ago, with operating margin at 65% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $10 billion or 67% of revenue, above our guidance of 66%. This figure excludes $142 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments. Starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $8.4 billion, with growth accelerating to 17% year-on-year, driven by AI. Semiconductor revenue represented 56% of total revenue in the quarter. Gross margin for our semiconductor solutions segment was approximately 69%, up 140 basis points year-on-year driven by product mix. Operating expenses increased 12% year-on-year to $971 million on increased investment in R&D for leading edge AI semiconductors. Semiconductor operating margin of 57% was up 200 basis points year-on-year. Now moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software of $6.6 billion was up 25% year-on-year and represented 44% of total revenue. Gross margin for infrastructure software was 93% in the quarter compared to 88% a year ago. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of approximately 76%. This compares to operating margin of 60% a year ago. This year-on-year improvement reflects our disciplined integration of VMware. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $6.4 billion and represented 43% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue continues to be impacted by increased interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition and increased cash taxes. We spent $144 million on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were 34 days in the second quarter compared to 40 days a year ago. We ended the second quarter with inventory of $2 billion, up 6% sequentially in anticipation of revenue growth in future quarters. Our days of inventory on hand were 69 days in Q2 as we continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the second quarter with $9.5 billion of cash and $69.4 billion of gross principal debt. Subsequent to quarter end, we repaid $1.6 billion of debt, resulting in gross principal debt of $67.8 billion. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $59.8 billion in fixed rate debt is 3.8% and 7 years, respectively. The weighted average interest rate and years to maturity of our $8 billion in floating rate debt is 5.3% and 2.6 years, respectively. Turning to capital allocation. In Q2, we paid stockholders $2.8 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.59 per share. In Q2, we repurchased $4.2 billion or approximately 25 million shares of common stock. In Q3, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.97 billion shares, excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases. Now moving on to guidance. Our guidance for Q3 is for consolidated revenue of $15.8 billion, up 21% year-on-year. We forecast semiconductor revenue of approximately $9.1 billion, up 25% year-on-year. Within this, we expect Q3 AI semiconductor revenue of $5.1 billion, up 60% year-on-year. We expect infrastructure software revenue of approximately $6.7 billion, up 16% year-on-year. For modeling purposes, we expect Q3 consolidated gross margin to be down approximately 130 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting a higher mix of XPUs within AI revenue. As a reminder, consolidated gross margins through the year will be impacted by the revenue mix of infrastructure software and semiconductors. We expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be at least 66%. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate for Q3 and fiscal year 2025 to remain at 14%. And with this, that concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Clark Seymore: Hock, I wanted to jump on to the AI side and specifically some of the commentary you had about next year. Can you just give a little bit more color on the inference commentary you gave? And is it more the XPU side, the connectivity side or both that's given you the confidence to talk about the growth rate that you have this year being matched next fiscal year?\nHock E. Tan: Thank you, Ross. Good question. I think we're indicating that what we are seeing and what we have quite a bit of visibility increasingly is increased deployment of XPUs next year, much more than we originally thought and hand-in-hand with it, of course, more and more networking. So it's a combination of both.\nRoss Clark Seymore: And the inference side of things?\nHock E. Tan: Yes, we're seeing much more inference now.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan L. Sur: Great job on the quarterly execution. Hock, good to see the positive growth inflection quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year growth rates in your AI business. As the team has mentioned, right, the quarters can be a bit lumpy. So if I smooth out kind of first 3 quarters of this fiscal year, your AI business is up 60% year-over-year. It's kind of right in line with your 3-year kind of SAM growth CAGR, right? Given your prepared remarks and knowing that your lead times remain at 35 weeks or better, do you see the Broadcom team sustaining the 60% year-over-year growth rate exiting this year. And I assume that, that potentially implies that you see your AI business sustaining the 60% year-over-year growth rate into fiscal '26, again, based on your prepared commentary, which again is in line with your SAM growth figure. Is that kind of a fair way to think about the trajectory this year and next year?\nHock E. Tan: Harlan, that's a very insightful set of analysis here, and that's exactly what we're trying to do here because over 6 months ago, we gave you guys a point, a year, 2027. As we come into the second half of 2025 and with improved visibility and updates we are seeing in the way our hyperscale partners are deploying data centers, AI clusters, we are providing you some level of guidance visibility what we are seeing, how the trajectory of '26 might look like. I'm not giving you any update on '27. We're just still establishing the update we have in '27 6 months ago. But what we're doing now is giving you more visibility into where we're seeing '26 headed.\nHarlan L. Sur: But is the framework that you laid out for us like second half of last year, which implies 60% kind of growth CAGR in your SAM opportunity, is that kind of the right way to think about it as it relates to the profile of growth in your business this year and next year?\nHock E. Tan: Yes.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes: Hock, networking -- AI networking was really strong in the quarter, and it seemed like it must have beat expectations. I was wondering if you could just talk about the networking in particular, what caused that? And how much of that is your acceleration into next year? And when do you think you see Tomahawk kicking in as part of that acceleration?\nHock E. Tan: Well, I think the AI networking, as you probably would know, goes pretty hand-in-hand with deployment of AI accelerator clusters. It isn't -- It doesn't deploy on a timetable that's very different from the way the accelerators get deployed, whether they are XPUs or GPUs. It does happen. And they deployed a lot in scale-out where Ethernet, of course, is the choice of protocol, but it's also increasingly moving into the space of what we all call scale up within those data centers, where you have much higher, more than we originally thought consumption or density of switches than you have in the scale-out scenario. In fact, the increased density in scale up is 5 to 10x more than in scale out. And that's the part that kind of pleasantly surprised us and which is why this past quarter, Q2, the AI networking portion continues at about 40% from what we reported a quarter ago for Q1. And at that time, I said I expect it to drop. It hasn't.\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes: And your thoughts on Tomahawk driving acceleration for next year and when it kicks in?\nHock E. Tan: Tomahawk 6, yes, that's extremely strong interest. Now we're not shipping big orders or any orders other than basic proof of concepts out to customers, but there is tremendous demand for this new 102 terabits per second Tomahawk switches.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies.\nBlayne Peter Curtis: Great results. I just wanted to ask maybe following up on the scale-out opportunity. So today, I guess your main customer is not really using kind of an NVLink switch style scale-up. I'm just kind of curious your visibility or the timing in terms of when you might be shipping a switched Ethernet scale-up network to your customers?\nHock E. Tan: You're talking scale up?\nBlayne Peter Curtis: Scale up.\nHock E. Tan: Yes. Well, scale up is very rapidly converting to Ethernet now, very much so. For our fairly narrow band of hyperscale customers, scale up is very much Ethernet.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.\nStacy Aaron Rasgon: Hock, I still wanted to follow up on that AI 2026 question. I want to just put some numbers on it, just to make sure I got it right. So if you did 60% in the first 3 quarters of this year, if you grow 60% year-over-year in Q4, it put you at like, I don't know, $5.8 billion, something like $19 billion or $20 billion for the year. And then are you saying you're going to grow 60% in 2026 would put you $30 billion plus in AI revenues for 2026? I'm just wondering, is that the math that you're trying to communicate to us directly?\nHock E. Tan: I think you're doing the math. I'm giving you the trend. But I did answer that question, I think Harlan asked earlier. The rate we are seeing now so far in fiscal '25 and will presumably continue, we don't see any reason why it doesn't given lead time visibility in '25. What we are seeing today based on what we have visibility on '26 is to be able to ramp up this AI revenue in the same trajectory. Yes.\nStacy Aaron Rasgon: So is the SAM going up as well because now you have inference on top of training. So is the SAM still 60 to 90? Or is the SAM higher now as you see it?\nHock E. Tan: I'm not playing a SAM game here. I'm just giving a trajectory towards where we drew the line on '27 before. So I have no response to if the SAM going up or not. Stop talking about SAM now.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: I had a near and then a longer-term question on the XPU business. So Hock, for near term, if your networking upsided in Q2 and overall AI was in line, it means XPU was perhaps not as strong. So I realize it's lumpy, but anything more to read into that, any product transition or anything else? So just a clarification there. And then longer term, you have outlined a number of additional customers that you're working with. What milestones should we look forward to? And what milestones are you watching to give you the confidence that you can now start adding their addressable opportunity into your '27 or '28 or other numbers? Like how do we get the confidence that these projects are going to turn into revenue in some reasonable time frame from now?\nHock E. Tan: Okay. On the first part that you're asking, it's like you're trying to be -- you're trying to count how many angels on a head of a pin here. I mean, whether it's XPU or networking. Networking is hot, but that doesn't mean XPU is any soften. It's very much along the trajectory we expect it to be. And there's no lumpiness. There's no softening. It's pretty much what we expect the trajectory to go so far and into next quarter as well and probably beyond. So we have a -- it's a fairly, I guess, in our view, a fairly clear visibility on the short-term trajectory. In terms of going on to '27, no, we are not updating any numbers here. We -- 6 months ago, we drew a sense for the size of the SAM based on million GPU XPU clusters for 3 customers, and that's still very valid at that point, that will be there. And we have not provided any further updates here nor are we intending to at this point. When we get a better visibility, clearer sense of where we are, and that probably won't happen until '26, we'll be happy to give an update to the audience. But right now, though, in today's prepared remarks and answering a couple of questions, we have -- we are -- as we are doing -- as we have done yet, we are intending to give you guys more visibility what we are seeing the growth trajectory in '26.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nChristopher James Muse: I was hoping to follow up on Ross's question regarding inference opportunity. Can you discuss workloads that are optimal that you're seeing for custom silicon? And that over time, what percentage of your XPU business could be inference versus training?\nHock E. Tan: I think there's no differentiation between training and inference in using merchant accelerators versus custom accelerators. I think the whole premise behind going towards custom accelerators continues, which is it's not a matter of cost alone. It is that as custom accelerators get used and get developed on a road map with any particular hyperscaler, there's a learning curve, a learning curve on how they could optimize the way the algorithms on their large language models gets written and tied to silicon. And that ability to do so is a huge value added in creating algorithms that can drive their LLMs to higher and higher performance, much more than basically a segregation approach between hardware and the software. It's that you literally combine end-to-end hardware and software as they take that journey. And it's a journey. They don't learn that in 1 year. Do it a few cycles, get better and better at it. And there lies the value -- the fundamental value in creating your own hardware versus using a third-party merchant silicon that you are able to optimize your software to the hardware and eventually achieve way high performance than you otherwise could. And we see that happening.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas.\nKarl Ackerman: Hock, you spoke about the much higher content opportunity in scale-up networking. I was hoping you could discuss how important is demand adoption for co-packaged optics in achieving this 5 to 10x higher content for scale-up networks? Or should we anticipate much of the scale-up opportunity will be driven by Tomahawk and Thor NICs?\nHock E. Tan: I'm trying to decipher this question of yours. So let me try to answer it perhaps in the way I think you want me to clarify. First and foremost, I think most of what's scaling up, a lot of the scaling up that's going, as I call it, which means a lot of XPU or GPU to GPU interconnects is done on copper interconnects. And because the size of this scale-up cluster is still not that huge yet that you can get away with copper -- using copper interconnects. And they're still doing it. Mostly, they're doing it today. At some point soon, I believe, when you start trying to go beyond maybe 72 GPU to GPU interconnects, you may have to push towards a different protocol by protocol mode at a different medium from copper to optical. And when we do that, yes, perhaps then things like exotic stuff like co-packaging might be of silicon with optical might become relevant. But truly, what we really are talking about is that at some stage, as the clusters get larger and which means scale up becomes much bigger and you need to interconnect GPU or XPU to each other in scale up many more than just 72 or 100, maybe even 128, you start going more and more. You want to use optical interconnects simply because of distance. And that's when optical will start replacing copper. And when that happens, the question is what's the best way to deliver on optical. And one way is co-packaged optics, but it's not the only way. You can just simply use -- continue to use perhaps pluggable at low-cost optics. In which case, then you can interconnect the bandwidth, the radix of a switch and our switch is now 512 connections. So you can now connect all these XPUs, GPUs, 512 for scale-up phenomenon. And that was huge, but that's when you go to optical. That's going to happen within my view, a year or 2, and we'll be right at the forefront of it. And it may be co-packaged optics, which we are very much in development, but it's a lock-in co-package or it could just be as a first step, pluggable optics. Whatever it is, I think the bigger question is when does it go for optical from copper connecting GPU to GPU to optical connecting it. And the step in that move will be huge. And it's not necessarily co-packaged optics. So that's definitely one path we are pursuing.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen.\nJoshua Louis Buchalter: I realize it's a bit nitpicky, but I wanted to ask about gross margins in the guide. So your revenue implies sort of $800 million incremental increase with gross profit up, I think, $400 million to $450 million, which is kind of pretty well below corporate average fall-through. I appreciate that semis is dilutive and custom is probably dilutive within semis. But anything else going on with margins that we should be aware of? And how should we think about the margin profile of custom longer term as that business continues to scale and diversify?\nKirsten M. Spears: Yes. We've historically said that the XPU margins are slightly lower than the rest of the business other than wireless. And so there's really nothing else going on other than that. It's just exactly what I said, that the majority of it quarter-over-quarter, the 130 basis point decline is being driven by more XPUs.\nHock E. Tan: There are more moving parts here than your simple analysis proves here. And I think your simple analysis is totally wrong in that regard.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Michael Arcuri: I also wanted to ask about scale up, Hock. So there's a lot of competing ecosystems. There's UALink, which, of course, you left. And now there's the big GPU company opening up NVLink, and they're both trying to build ecosystems, and there's an argument that you're an ecosystem of one. What would you say to that debate? Does opening up NVLink change the landscape? And sort of how do you view of your AI networking growth next year? Do you think it's going to be primarily driven by scale up? Or will it still be pretty scale-out heavy?\nHock E. Tan: It's -- people do like to create platforms and new protocols and systems. The fact of the matter is scale up can just be done easily, and it's currently available. It's open standards, open source, Ethernet. Just as well, you don't need to create new systems for the sake of doing something that you could easily be doing in networking in Ethernet. And so yes, I hear a lot of this interesting new protocols, standards that are trying to be created. And most of them, by the way, are proprietary, much as they like to call it otherwise. What is really open source and open standards is Ethernet. And we believe Ethernet will prevail as it does before -- for the last 20 years in traditional networking. There is no reason to create a new standard for something that could be easily done in transferring bits and bytes of data.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.\nChristopher Adam Jackson Rolland: Yes. My question is for you, Hock. It's kind of a bigger picture one here. And this kind of acceleration that we're seeing in AI demand, do you think that this acceleration is because of a marked improvement in ASICs or XPUs closing the gap on the software side at your customers? Do you think it's these require tokenomics around inference, test time compute driving that, for example. What do you think is actually driving the upside here? And do you think it leads to a market share shift faster than we were expecting towards XPU from GPU?\nHock E. Tan: Yes. Interesting question, but none of the foregoing that you outlined. It's very simple, why inference has come out very, very hot lately is -- remember, we're only selling to a few customers, hyperscalers with platforms and LLMs. That's it. There are not that many. And we have told you how many we have, and we haven't increased any. But what is happening is these hyperscalers and those with LLMs need to justify all the spending they're doing. Doing training makes your frontier models smarter. There's no question. It's almost like science, research and science. Make your frontier models by creating very clever algorithms that consumes a lot of compute for training smarter. Training makes it smarter. You want to monetize inference. And that's what's driving it. Monetize, I indicated in my prepared remarks, to drive to justify a return on investment and a lot of that investment is training and that return on investment is by creating use cases, a lot of AI use cases, AI consumption out there through availability of a lot of inference. And that's what we are now starting to see among our small group of customers.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh: Hock, just going back on the AI server revenue side. I know you said fiscal '25 kind of tracking to that up 60%-ish growth. If you look at fiscal '26, you have many new customers ramping [ Meta ] and probably you have the 4 of the 6 hyperscalers that you have talked in the past. Would you expect that growth to accelerate into fiscal '26 about that kind of the 60% you talked about?\nHock E. Tan: My prepared remarks and which I clarified that the rate of growth we are seeing in '25 will sustain into '26 based on improved visibility and the fact that we're seeing inference coming in on top of the demand for training as the clusters get built up bigger and bigger, still stands. I don't think we are getting very far by trying to pass through my words or data here. It's just a -- it is and we see that going from '25 into '26 as the best forecast we have at this point.\nVijay Raghavan Rakesh: Got it. And on the NVLink Fusion versus the scale up, do you expect that market to go the route of top of the rack where you've seen some move to the Ethernet side in kind of the scale-out. Do you expect scale up to kind of go the same route?\nHock E. Tan: Broadcom do not participate in NVLink. So I'm really not qualified to answer that question, I think.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Christopher Rakers: I think all my questions on scale-up have been asked. But I guess, Hock, given the execution that you guys have been able to do with the VMware integration, looking at the balance sheet, looking at the debt structure, I'm curious if you could give us your thoughts on how the company thinks about capital return versus the thoughts on M&A and the strategy going forward.\nHock E. Tan: Okay. That's an interesting question. And I agree, not too untimely, I would say, because, yes, we have done a lot of the integration of VMware now, and you can see that in the level of free cash flow we're generating from operations. And as we said, the use of capital has always been -- we're very, I guess, measured and upfront with a return through dividends, which is half our free cash flow of the preceding year. And frankly, as Kirsten has mentioned 3 months ago and 6 months ago during the last 2 earnings call, the first choice typically of the other part of the free cash flow is to bring down our debt to a more -- to a level that we feel closer to no more than 2 ratio of debt to EBITDA. And that doesn't mean that opportunistically, we may go out there and buy back our shares as we did last quarter, and indicated by Kirsten, when we did $4.2 billion of stock buyback. Now part of it is used to basically when employee RSUs vest basically use -- we basically buy back part of the shares used to be paying taxes on the vested RSU. But the other part of it, I do admit we used it opportunistically last quarter when we see an situation when basically, we think that it's a good time to buy some shares back, and we do. But having said all that, our use of cash outside of dividends would be, at this stage, used towards reducing our debt. And I know you're going to ask what about M&A? Well, the kind of M&A we will do in our view would be significant, would be substantial enough that we need debt in any case. And it's a good use of our free cash flow to bring down debt to, in a way, expand, if not preserve our borrowing capacity if we have to do another M&A deal.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James.\nSrinivas Reddy Pajjuri: Hock, a couple of clarifications. First, on your 2026 expectation, are you assuming any meaningful contribution from the 4 prospects that you talked about?\nHock E. Tan: No comment. We don't talk about prospects. We only talk about customers.\nSrinivas Reddy Pajjuri: Okay. Fair enough. And then my other clarification is that I think you talked about networking being about 40% of the mix within AI. Is that the right kind of mix that you expect going forward? Or is that going to materially change as we, I guess, see XPUs ramping going forward?\nHock E. Tan: No. I've always said and I expect that to be the case going forward in '26 as we grow that networking should be a ratio to XPU should be closer in the range of less than 30%, not the 40%.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Lawrence Moore: You said you're not going to be impacted by export controls on AI. I know there's been a number of changes since -- in the industry since the last time you made the call. Is that still the case? And just can you give people comfort that there's no impact from that down the road?\nHock E. Tan: Nobody can give anybody comfort in this environment, Joe. But rules are changing quite dramatically as trade -- bilateral trade agreements continue to be negotiated in a very, very dynamic environment. So I'll be honest, I don't know -- I know as little as probably -- you probably know more than I do maybe, in which case then I know very little about this whole thing about whether there's any export control, how the export control will take place. We're guessing. So I'd rather not answer that because no, I don't know whether it won't be.\nOperator: And we do have time for one final question. And that will come from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities.\nWilliam Stein: I wanted to ask about VMware. Can you comment as to how far along you are in the process of converting customers to the subscription model? Is that close to complete? Or is there still a number of quarters that we should expect that, that conversion continues?\nHock E. Tan: That's a good question. And so let me start off by saying a good way to measure it is most of our VMware contracts are about typically 3 years. And that was what VMware did before we acquired them, and that's pretty much what we continue to do, 3 is very traditional. So based on that, the renewals, we are like 2/3 of the way, almost to the halfway -- more than halfway through the renewals. So we probably have at least another year plus, maybe 1.5 years to go.\nOperator: And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ji Yoo for closing remarks.\nJi Yoo: Thank you, operator. Broadcom currently plans to report its earnings for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 after close of market on Thursday, September 4, 2025. A public webcast of Broadcom's earnings conference call will follow at 2:00 p.m. Pacific. That will conclude our earnings call today. Thank you all for joining. Operator, you may end the call.",

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Gu, Head of Investor Relations of Broadcom Inc.\nGu: Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Hock Tan, President and CEO, Kirsten Spears, Chief Financial Officer, and Charlie Kawwas, President, Semiconductor Solutions Group. Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables after the market closed describing our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. If you did not receive a copy, you may obtain the information from the investors section of Broadcom's website at broadcom.com. This conference call is being webcast live, and an audio replay of the call can be accessed for one year through the investors section of Broadcom's website. During the prepared comments, Hock and Kirsten will be providing details of our first quarter fiscal year 2025 results, guidance for our second quarter of fiscal year 2025, as well as commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. In addition to US GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today's press release. Comments made during today's call will primarily refer to our non-GAAP financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Hock.\nHock Tan: Thank you, Gu. And thank you everyone for joining today. In our fiscal Q1 2025, total revenue was a record $14.9 billion, up 25% year on year. And consolidated adjusted EBITDA was a record again, $10.1 billion, up 41% year on year. So let me first provide color on our semiconductor business. Q1 semiconductor revenue was $8.2 billion, 11% year on year. Growth was driven by AI, as AI revenue of $4.1 billion was up 77% year on year. We repeat our guidance for AI revenue of $3.8 billion due to stronger shipments of networking solutions to hyperscalers on AI. Our hyperscale partners continue to invest aggressively in the next generation Frontier models, which do require high-performance accelerators as well as AI data centers with larger clusters. Consistent with this, we are stepping up our R&D investment on two fronts. One, we're pushing the envelope of technology in creating the next generation of accelerators. We're taping out the industry's first two-nanometer AI XPU packaging 3.5D, as we drive towards a 10,000 teraflops XPU. Secondly, we have a view towards scaling clusters of 500,000 accelerators for hyperscale customers. We have doubled the radix capacity of this of the existing Tomahawk 5. And beyond this, to enable AI clusters to scale up on Ethernet towards one million XPUs. We have taped out our next-generation 100 terabit Tomahawk 6 switch running 200G SerDes and 1.6 terabit bandwidth. We will be delivering samples to customers within the next few months. These R&D investments are very aligned with the roadmap of our three hyperscale customers as they each race towards one million XPU clusters by the end of 2027. And, accordingly, we do reaffirm what we said last quarter, that we expect these three hyperscale customers will generate a serviceable addressable market or SAM in the range of $60 to $90 billion in fiscal 2027. Beyond these three customers, we had also mentioned previously that we are deeply engaged with two other hyperscalers in enabling them to create their own customized AI accelerator. We are on track to tape out their XPUs this year. In the process of working with the hyperscalers, it has become very clear that while they are excellent in software, Broadcom is the best in hardware. Working together is what optimizes large language models. It is therefore no surprise to us since our last earnings call, the two additional hyperscalers have selected Broadcom to develop custom accelerators to train their next-generation Frontier models. So even as we have three hyperscale customers, we are shipping XPUs in volume today. There are now four more who are deeply engaged with us to create their own accelerators. And to be clear, of course, these four are not included in our estimated SAM of $60 billion to $90 billion in 2027. So we do see an exciting trend here. New Frontier models and techniques put unexpected pressures on AI systems. It's difficult to serve all classes of models with a single system design point. And therefore, it is hard to imagine that a general-purpose accelerator can be configured and optimized across multiple Frontier models. And as I mentioned before, the trend towards XPUs is a multiyear journey. So coming back to 2025, we see a steady ramp in deployment of all our XPUs and networking products. So Q1 AI revenue was $4.1 billion, and we expect Q2 AI revenue to grow to $4.4 billion, which is up 44% year on year. Turning to non-AI semiconductors, revenue of $4.1 billion was down 9% sequentially on a seasonal decline in wireless. In aggregate, during Q1, the recovery in non-AI semiconductors continues to be slow. Broadband, which bottomed in Q4 2024, showed a double-digit sequential recovery in Q1 and is expected to be up similarly in Q2 as service providers and telcos step up spending. Server storage was down single digits sequentially in Q1 but is expected to be up high single digits sequentially in Q2. Meanwhile, enterprise networking continues to remain flattish in the first half of fiscal 2025 as customers continue to work through channel inventory. Wireless was down sequentially due to a seasonal decline. It remained flat year on year. In Q2, wireless is expected to be the same, flat again year on year. Resales in industrial were down double digits in Q1 and are expected to be down in Q2. So reflecting the foregoing puts and takes, we expect non-AI semiconductor revenue in Q2 to be flattish sequentially even though we are seeing bookings continue to grow year on year. In summary, for Q2, we expect total semiconductor revenue to grow 2% sequentially and up 17% year on year to $8.4 billion. Turning now to infrastructure software. Q1 infrastructure software revenue of $6.7 billion was up 47% year on year and up 15% sequentially, exaggerated though by deals which slipped from Q4 to Q1. Now this is the first quarter Q1 2025 where the year on year comparables include VMware in both quarters. We're seeing significant growth in the software segment for two reasons. One, we're converting from a footprint of largely perpetual licenses to one of full subscription. And as of today, we are over 60% done. Two, these perpetual licenses were only largely for virtualization, otherwise called vSphere. We are upselling customers to a full stack VCF, which enables the entire data center to be virtualized and enables customers to create their own private cloud environment on-prem. And as of the end of Q1, approximately 70% of our largest 10,000 customers have adopted VCF. As these customers consume VCF, we do see a further opportunity for future growth. As large enterprises adopt AI, they have to run their AI workloads on their on-prem data centers, which will include both GPU servers as well as traditional CPUs. And just as VCF virtualizes these traditional data centers using CPUs, VCM will also virtualize GPUs on a common platform and then enable enterprises to import AI models to run their own data on-prem. This platform, which virtualizes the GPU, is called the VMware Private AI Foundation. And as of today, in collaboration with NVIDIA, we have 39 enterprise customers for the VMware Private AI Foundation. Customer demand has been driven by our open ecosystem, superior load balancing, and automation capabilities, which allow them to intelligently pool and run workloads across both GPU and CPU infrastructure, leading to very reduced costs. Moving on to Q2 outlook for software, we expect revenue of $6.5 billion, up 23% year on year. So in total, we're guiding Q2 consolidated revenue to be approximately $14.9 billion, up 19% year on year. And we expect this will drive Q2 adjusted EBITDA to approximately 66% of revenue. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.\nKirsten Spears: Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q1 financial performance. From a year on year comparable basis, keep in mind that Q1 of fiscal 2024 was a 14-week quarter and Q1 of fiscal 2025 is a 13-week quarter. Consolidated revenue was $14.9 billion for the quarter, up 25% from a year ago. Gross margin was 79.1% of revenue in the quarter, better than we originally guided on higher infrastructure software revenue and more favorable semiconductor revenue mix. Consolidated operating expenses were $2 billion, of which $1.4 billion was for R&D. Q1 operating income of $9.8 billion was up 44% from a year ago with operating margin at 66% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was a record $10.1 billion or 68% of revenue, above our guidance of 66%. This figure excludes $142 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments. Starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $8.2 billion and represented 55% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 11% year on year. Gross margin for our semiconductor solutions segment was approximately 68%, up 70 basis points year on year driven by revenue mix. Operating expenses increased 3% year on year to $890 million on increased investment in R&D for leading-edge AI semiconductors, resulting in semiconductor operating margin of 57%. Now moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software of $6.7 billion was 45% and up 47% year on year based primarily on increased revenue from VMware. Gross margin for infrastructure software was 92.5% in the quarter compared to 88% a year ago. Operating expenses were approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 76%. This compares to operating margin of 59% a year ago. This year on year improvement reflects our disciplined integration of VMware and sharp focus on deploying our VCF strategy. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $6 billion and represented 40% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue continues to be impacted by cash interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition and cash taxes due to the mix of US taxable income, the continued delay in the reenactment of section 174, and the impact of Corporate AMT. We spent $100 million on capital expenditures. Day sales outstanding were 30 days in the first quarter compared to 41 days a year ago. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 8% sequentially, to support revenue in future quarters. Our days of inventory on hand were 65 days in Q1 as we continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the first quarter with $9.3 billion of cash and $68.8 billion of gross principal debt. During the quarter, we repaid $495 million of fixed-rate debt and $7.6 billion of floating-rate debt with new senior notes, commercial paper, and cash on hand, reducing debt by a net $1.1 billion. Following these actions, the weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $58.8 billion in fixed-rate debt is 3.8% and 7.3 years respectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $6 billion in floating-rate debt is 5.4% and 3.8 years respectively. And our $4 billion in commercial paper is at an average rate of 4.6%. Turning to capital allocation. In Q1, we paid stockholders $2.8 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $59 per share. We spent $2 billion to repurchase 8.7 million AVGO shares from employees as those shares vested or withholding taxes. In Q2, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.95 billion shares. Now moving on to guidance. Our guidance for Q2 is for consolidated revenue of $14.9 billion with semiconductor revenue of approximately $8.4 billion, up 17% year on year. We expect Q2 AI revenue of $4.4 billion, up 44% year on year. For non-AI semiconductors, we expect Q2 revenue of $4 billion. We expect Q2 infrastructure software revenue of approximately $6.5 billion, up 23% year on year. We expect Q2 adjusted EBITDA to be about 66%. For modeling purposes, we expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to be down approximately 20 basis points sequentially on the revenue mix of infrastructure software. As Hock discussed earlier, we are increasing our R&D investment in leading-edge AI in Q2 and accordingly, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 66%. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate for Q2 and fiscal year 2025 to be approximately 14%. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we will now open for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press star one one again. Due to time restraints, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Please standby while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question will come from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot and congrats on the results. Hock, you talked about four more customers coming online. Can you just talk a little bit more about the trend you're seeing, can any of these customers be as big as the current three? And what does this say about the custom silicon trend overall and your optimism and upside to the business long term? Thanks.\nHock Tan: Well, very interesting question, Ben. And thanks for your kind wishes. But what we're seeing is and by the way, these four are not customers as we define it. As I've always said, you know, in developing and creating XPUs, you know, we are not really the creator of those XPUs, to be honest. We enable each of those hyperscalers partners we engage with to create that chip and to basically, to create that compute system. Call it that way. And it comprises the model, the software model, working closely with the compute engine, the XPU, and the networking that ties together the clusters of those multiple XPUs as a whole to train those large Frontier models. And so you know, and the fact that we create the hardware it still has to work with the software models and the algorithms of those partners of ours before it becomes fully deployable and scale, which is why we define customers in this case as those where we know they have deployed at scale and we'll receive the production volume to enable it. Right. For that, we only have just the three. The four are, I call it partners, who are trying to create the same thing as the first three and to run their own Frontier models, each of it on there to train their own Frontier models. And as I also said, it doesn't happen overnight. To do the first chip, could take would take typically a year and a half. And that's very accelerated and which we could accelerate given that we essentially have a framework and a methodology that works right now. It works for the three customers. No reason for it to not work for the four. Still need those four partners to create and to develop a software which we don't do to make it work, and to answer your question, there's no reason why these four guys would not create a demand in the range of what we're seeing with the first three guys. But probably later. It's a journey. They started it later. And so they will probably get there later.\nBen Reitzes: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon, and great job on the strong quarterly results, Hock and team. Great to see the continual momentum in the AI business here in the first half of your fiscal year, and the continued broadening out of your AI ASIC customers. I know, Hock, last earnings, you did call out a strong ramp in the second half of the fiscal year, driven by new three-nanometer AI accelerated programs kinda ramping. You just help us either qualitatively, quantitatively, profile the second half step up relative to what the team just delivered here in the first half? Has the profile changed? Either favorably less favorably versus what you thought, maybe ninety days ago because quite frankly, I mean, a lot has happened since last earnings. Right? You've had the dynamics like deep seek and focus on AI model efficiency. But on the flip side, you've had strong CapEx outlooks by your cloud and hyperscale customers. So any color on the second half AI profile would be helpful.\nHock Tan: You're asking me to look into the minds of my customers. And I hate to tell you they don't tell me, they don't show me the entire mindset here. But one why are we beating the numbers so far in Q1? Seems to be encouraging in Q2. Pardon me? From improved networking shipments, as I indicate that's to foster those XPUs and AI accelerators even in some cases GPUs together, for the hyperscalers. And that's good. And partly, also, we think there is some pull-ins of shipments and acceleration, call it that way, of shipments yes, in fiscal 2025.\nHarlan Sur: And on the second half, that you talked about ninety days ago, the second half three-nanometer ramp, is that still very much on track?\nHock Tan: Alan, thank you. I only got you two. Sorry. Let me let's not speculate on the second half.\nHarlan Sur: Okay. Thank you, Hock.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nWilliam Stein: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Congrats on these pretty great results. It you know, it seems from the news headlines about tariffs and about Deepseek that there may be some disruption. Some customers and some other complementary suppliers seem to feel a bit paralyzed perhaps. Have difficulty making tough decisions. Those tend to be you know, really useful times for great companies to sort of emerge as something bigger and better than they were in the past. You've, you know, grown this company in a tremendous way over the last, you know, decade plus. And you're doing great now, especially in this AI area. But I wonder if you're seeing that sort of disruption from these dynamics that we suspect are happening based on, you know, headlines of what we see from other companies. And how aside from adding these customers in AI, sure there's other great stuff going on, but should we expect some bigger changes to come from Broadcom as a result of this?\nHock Tan: You post a very interesting set of issues and questions. And those are very relevant interesting issues. And don't need issue the only problem we have at this point is I would say it's really toward to no way we're all linked. I mean, there's the threat, the noise of tariffs, especially on chips, that has a material lines in it. Nor do we know how it will be structured. So we don't know. But we do experience and we are leaving it now. Is the disruption on that is paused in a positive way. I should add a very positive disruption in semiconductors, on a generative AI. Generative AI for sure. And we I said that before, so at the risk of repeating, you know, but it's we feel it more than ever. Is really accelerating the development of semiconductor technology. Both process and packaging as well as design. Towards higher and higher performance accelerators and networking functionality. We've seen that innovation that those upgrades occur on a every month. As we face new interesting challenges. And when particularly with XPUs. We're trying within as to optimize to Frontier models of our partners, our customers, as well as our hyperscale partners. And we it's a lot of I mean, it's a it's a privilege almost for us to be to participate in it and try to optimize. And by optimize, I mean, you look at an accelerator. You can look at it for simple terms, high level, to to perform, to want to maybe mention not just on one single mentoring, which is compute capacity, how many teraflops? It's more than that. It's also tied to the fact that this is a distributed computing problem. It's not just the sing the compute capacity of a single XPU or GPU. It's also the network bandwidth. It ties itself to the next adjacent XPU or GPU. So that has an impact. So you're doing that. You'll have the balance with that. Then you decide, are you doing training or you're doing prefilling? Post training. Fine tuning. And again then comes how much memory do you balance against that? And with it, how much latency you can afford, which is memory bandwidth. So you will look at the at least four variables, maybe even five. If you're in clone in memory bandwidth. Not just memory capacity, when you go straight to inference. So we we have all these variables to play with and we try to optimize it. So all this is very, very I mean, it's a great experience for our engineers to push their envelope on how to create all those chips and so that's the biggest disruption we see right now. From sheer trying to create and push the envelope on generative AI. Trying to create the best hardware infrastructure to run it. Beyond that, yeah, there are there are other things too that come into play because with AI, as I indicated, just not just drive hardware for enterprises, it drives the way the architect their data centers. You know, data requirement they keep keeping data private on on under control becomes important. So suddenly, the push of what loads towards public cloud. May take a little pause as large enterprises particularly, have to they have to take direct device that you want to run AI workloads. You're probably thinking very hard about running them on-prem. And suddenly, push yourself to a saying, got to upgrade your own data centers. To do you know, and manage the your own data to run it on-prem. And that's also pushing a trend that with we have been seeing now over the past twelve months. Hence, my comments on VMware Private AI Foundation. This is to especially enterprises pushing direction at quickly recognizing that how where do they run their AI workloads. So those are trends we see today and a lot of it coming out of AI, a lot of it coming out of sensitive rules on sovereignty, in cloud and in data. On as far as you're mentioning tariffs is concerned, I think that's too early for us to figure out where to online. And probably maybe give it another three, six months we probably have a better idea where to go.\nWilliam Stein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nRoss Seymore: May I speak to a ask a question. I want to go back to the XPU side of things. And going from the four new engagements, not yet named customers, two last quarter and two more today that you announced. I wanna talk about going from kind of design winded deployment. How do you judge that? Because there is some debate about, you know, tons of design wins, but the deployments actually don't happen either that they never occur or that the volume is never what is originally promised. How do you view that kind of conversion ratio with there a wide range around it? Or is there some way you could help us kind of understand how that works?\nHock Tan: Well, it's and, Ross, the interesting question I'll take the opportunity to say the way we look at designing is probably very different from the way many of our peers look at it out there. Number one, to begin with, we believe design win when we know our product is at in produced in scale, at scale and is actually deployed. Literally deployed in production. So that takes a long lead time because from taping out getting in the product, it takes a year. Easily from the product in the hands. Of our partner to when it goes into scale production, it will take six months to a year. It's our experience that we've seen. Number one and number two. I mean, producing and deploying five thousand SKUs that's that's a joke. That's not real production in my in our view. And so we also limit ourselves in selecting partners to people who really need that large volume. You need that large volume from our viewpoint in scale right now. In mostly framing, training of large language models from tier models in a continuing trajectory. So we limit ourselves to how many customers or how many potential customers that exist out there, Ross. And we tend to be very selective who we pick. The beginning. So when we say design win, it really is at scale. It's not something that starts in six months and die or a year and die again. Basically, it's a selection of custom. It just the way we run our ASIC business in general for the last fifteen years. We pick and choose the customers because we know this guy and we do multi multi-year roadmaps with these customers because we know these customers are sustainable. I put it bluntly. We don't do it for start-ups.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nStacy Rasgon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go to the three customers that you do have in volume today. And what I wanted to ask was is there any concern about some of the new regulations or the AI diffusion rules that are gonna get put in place supposedly in May impacting any of those design wins or shipments. It sounds like you think all three of those are still on at this point. But anything you could tell us about worries about new regulations or AI diffusions impacting any of those wins would be helpful.\nHock Tan: Thank you. In this era or this current era of geopolitical tensions, and fairly dramatic actions all around by governments, yes, always some concern at the back of everybody's mind. But to answer your question directly, no. We don't have any concerns.\nStacy Rasgon: Got it. So none of those are going into China? Or to Chinese customers then?\nHock Tan: No comment. Are you trying to locate who they are?\nStacy Rasgon: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Hock, whenever you have described your AI opportunity, you've always emphasized the training workload. But the perception is that the AI market could be dominated by the inference workload, especially with these new reasoning models. So what happens to your opportunity and share if the mix moves more towards inference, does it, you know, does it create a bigger TAM you than the $60 to $90 billion? You know, does it keep it the same, but is there is a different mix of product? Or does a more inference-heavy market favor a GPU over an XPU? Thank you.\nHock Tan: That's a good interesting question. By the way, I never I do talk a lot about training. We do out check our experience as also focus on inference as a separate product line. They do. And that's why I can say the architecture of those chips are very different from the architecture of the training chips. And so it's a combination of those two, I should add. That adds up to this $60 to $90 billion. So if I had not been clear I do apologize. It's a combination of both. But having said that, the larger part of the dollars come from training. Not inference. If within the server service, the same that we have talked about so far. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nHarsh Kumar: Thanks, Broadcom team. And again, great execution. Just talk had a quick question. We've been hearing that almost all of the large clusters that are 100k plus they're all going to Ethernet. I was wondering if you could help us understand the importance of when the customer's making a selection, you know, choosing between a guy that has the best switch ASICs such as you, versus a guy that might have to compute there. Can you talk about what the customer is thinking and what are the final points that they wanna hit upon when they make that selection for the mixed cards?\nHock Tan: Okay. I see. No. It's a com yeah. It's down to in the in the case of the in the case of the hyperscalers, now very much so, it's very driven by performance. And it's performance what you're mentioning about on connecting scaling up, and scaling out those AI accelerators, be they XPU or GPU. Among extra scalers. And in main most cases, among those hyperscalers we engage with, when it comes to connecting those clusters. They're very driven. By performance. I mean, you if you are in the race to really get the best performance out of your hardware as you train and continue to train your Frontier models, that matters more than anything else. So the basic first thing they go for is proven. That's a proven piece of hardware is a proven net it's a proven system subsystem in our case that makes it work. And in that case, we tend to have a big advantage. Because, I mean, networking is ours. You know, switching and routing is ours for the last ten years at least. And the fact that it's AI just makes it more interesting for our engineers to work on. And but it's basically based on proven technology and experience in pushing that and pushing the envelope on going from 800 gigabit per second bandwidth to 1.6 and moving on to 3.2, which is exactly why we keep stepping up the rate of investment in coming up with our products where we take a ton of five. We doubled the radix to deal with just one hyperscaler because they want high radix to create larger clusters while running, bandwidth that are smaller but that doesn't stop us from moving ahead to the next generation of Tomahawk 6 and I dare say, we even planning to come out 7 and 8 right now. And we're speeding up the rate of development. And it's all actually for that few guys, by the way. So we're making a lot of investment for very few customers, hopefully, with very large serve available markets. That's if I'm nothing else, that's the big bets we are placing.\nHarsh Kumar: Thank you, Hock.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Hock, in the past, you have mentioned XPU units growing from about two million last year to about seven million, you said, in the 2027, 2028 time frame. My question is, do these four new customers, do they add to that seven million unit number? I know in the past, you sort of talked about an ASP. It was, you know, twenty grand by then. So those three the first three customers are clearly a subset of that seven million units. So do these new four engagements drive that seven higher, or do they just fill in to get to that seven million? Thanks.\nHock Tan: Thanks, Tim, for asking that. To clarify, as I made I thought I made it clear in my comments. No. The market we're talking about include when you translate the unit it's only among the three customers we have today. The other four, we talk about engagement partners, we don't consider that as customers yet, and therefore, are not in our served available market.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. So they would add to that number. Okay. Thanks, Hock.\nOperator: Thanks. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nCJ Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, I'll have to follow-up on your prepared remarks and comments earlier around optimization with your best hardware and hyperscalers with their great software. I'm curious how you're expanding your portfolio now to six mega scale kind of frontier models. Will enable you to, you know, a more plush, you know, share tremendous information, but at the same time, a world where these six truly wanna differentiate. So, obviously, you know, the goal for all of these players is exaflops, per second per dollar of capex per watt. And I guess to what degree are you aiding them in these efforts? And where does maybe the Chinese wall kinda start where they wanna kinda differentiate and not share with you kind of some of the work that you're doing.\nHock Tan: You. Oh, you know, we only provide very base basic fundamental technology in semiconductors to enable these guys to use what we have and optimize it to their own particular models. And algorithms that relate to those models. That's it. That's all we do. So that's the level of a lot of that optimization we do for each of them. And as I mentioned earlier, there are maybe five degrees of freedom. Yeah. We do. And we play with that. And so even if there are five degrees of freedom, there's only so much we can do at that point. But it is and how did you and then basically, how we optimize it is all tied to the partner telling us how they want to do to do it. So that's only so much we also have visibility on. But it's but it's what we do now is what the XPU model is. She optimization translating to performance but also power. That's very important how they play. It's not just cost. The power come translates into total cost of ownership. Eventually. It's it's how design it in power and how we balance it in terms of the size of the cluster and whether they use it for training. No. Pretraining? Post training? Inference you know, time test time scaling, all of them have their own characteristics. And that's the advantage of doing that XPU and working closely with them to create that stuff. Now as far as your question on China and all that, frankly, I don't have any opinion on that at all. To us, it's a technical game.\nCJ Muse: Thank you very much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nChristopher Rolland: Hey. Thanks so much for the question. And this one's maybe for Hock and for Kirsten. I'd love to know just because you have kind of the complete connectivity portfolio, how you see new greenfield scale-up opportunities playing out here between you know, could be optical or copper or really anything and what additives this could be for your company. And then, Kirsten, I think, OpEx is up. Maybe just talk about where those OpEx dollars are going towards within the AI opportunity and whether they relate. Thanks so much.\nHock Tan: Your question is very broad-reaching. In our portfolio. Yeah. We deploy we have the advantage as a and a lot of the customer hyperscalers they're talking about a lot of expansion. But it's all almost all greenfield. You know, bless soul brownfield. It's very greenfield. It's all expansion. And it all tends to be next generation. That we're doing. Which is very exciting. So the opportunity is very, very high. And we deploy I mean, we are both we can do it in copper, but what we see a lot of opportunity from is when you connect provide the networking connectivity through optical. But there are a lot of active elements including either, you know, multimode lasers which are called VCSELs or intervening lasers. For basically single mode. And we do both. So there's a lot of opportunity just as in scale scale-up versus scale-up. We used to do we still do a lot of other protocols beyond Ethernet to consider PCI Express where we on the leading edge of that PCI Express. And that architecture on networking, switching, so to speak, we offered both. One is a very intelligent switch which is, like, our Jericho family. We've a Dominic or a very smart NIC, we've got down switch, which is a Tomahawk. We offer both architectures as well. So, yeah, we have a lot of opportunities from it. All things said and done, all this nice white portfolio and all that, adds up to probably, as I said in prior quarters, about 20% of our total AI revenue maybe going to 30%. Though last quarter, we hit almost 40%, but that's not the norm. I would say typically, all those other portfolio products still end up to a nice decent amount of revenue for us, but within the sphere of AI, they add up to I would say on average, be close to 30%. And XPUs, the accelerators, is 70%. If that's what you're driving at, perhaps that give you some shed some light on towards where, how one matters over the other. But we have a wide range of products connectivity, networking side of it. They just add up though to that 30%.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks so much, Hock.\nKirsten Spears: And then on the R&D front, as I outlined at a consolidated basis, we spent $1.4 billion in R&D in Q1, and IT stated that it would be going up in Q2. Hock clearly outlined in his script the two areas where we're focusing on. Now I would tell you the company we focus on R&D across all of our product lines so that we can stay competitive with next-generation product offerings, but he did line out that we are focusing on taping out the industry's first two-nanometer AIXPU package in 3D. That was one in the script, and that's an area that we're focusing on. And then he mentioned that we've doubled the radix capacity of existing Tomahawk 5. To enable our AI customers to scale up on Ethernet. Towards the one million XPUs. I mean, that's a huge focus of the company.\nChristopher Rolland: Yep. Thank you very much, Kirsten.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nVijay Rakesh: Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Thanks. Just a question on the networking side. Just wondering how much does up sequentially on the AI side? And any thoughts around M&A going forward? Still a lot of headlines around the include products, Blue Care, so thanks.\nHock Tan: On the networking side, as indicated, Q1 showed a bit of a surge. But I don't expect that to be that mix of sixty-forty-sixty is compute and forty percent networking to be something that is normal? I think the norm is closer to seventy, thirty, maybe. At best, thirty percent. And so who knows what Q2 is? We cannot see Q2 as continuing but that's just, at my mind, a temporary flip. The norm will be seventy thirty. If you take it across, a period of time, like six months, a year, that's your question. M&A, no. I'm too busy we're too busy doing AI and VMware at this point. We're not thinking of it. At this point.\nVijay Rakesh: Thanks, Hock.\nOperator: Thank you. That is all the time we have for our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gu for any closing remarks.\nGu: Thank you, Sherry.
