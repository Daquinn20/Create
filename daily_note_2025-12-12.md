### Our thinking on Hong Kong Property
*Received: Thu, 11 Dec 2025 16:01:43 +0000 (UTC)*

- **Economic Environment**: The newsletter attributes the current struggles to rising interest rates matching the U.S. Federal Reserve's increases from March 2022 to July 2023, which has made financing less accessible and increased market volatility.

### AI Fears Eclipse Fed Rate Hopes. Why Oracle Earnings Should Concern Stock Markets.
*Received: Thu, 11 Dec 2025 22:59:52 +1100*

- **Market Response to Fed Rate Cut**: The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point, boosting the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 498 points, marking its best performance on a Fed Day since December 2023. This raised hopes for further rate reductions in 2026. 

- **Oracle's Impact on Markets**: Oracle's second-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, but an increased spending forecast to build AI-related data centers raised investor concerns. The company has a $523 billion revenue backlog, heavily reliant on a $300 billion contract with OpenAI, resulting in uncertainty about both Oracle's and the AI sector's sustainability.

- **Looking Ahead**: Upcoming earnings reports, notably from Broadcom, could further influence market sentiment. Despite Powell's optimistic outlook, concerns over Oracle's spending and potential AI bubble may hinder year-end market gains, possibly affecting the anticipated Santa rally.
