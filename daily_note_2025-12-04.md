### Our thinking on gold, bitcoin and mining services
*Received: Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:05:24 +0000 (UTC)*

- **Market Insights on Crypto and Gold**: The newsletter discusses the transient nature of companies adopting a bitcoin treasury strategy, emphasizing that many lack intrinsic value. Despite significant venture capital investment in finding Bitcoin use cases, few have emerged.
