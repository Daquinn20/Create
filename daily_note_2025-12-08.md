### Re: WHAT TRADERS ARE WATCHING THIS MORNING
*Received: Sun, 7 Dec 2025 19:55:48 -0000*

- **Key Headlines**: President Trump's announcement of a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods starting August 1 has significant implications for U.S.-Brazil trade relations, impacting a $92 billion market. Additionally, Japan's 20-year government bond auction drew modest interest ahead of upcoming elections.

- **Important Data Points**: Brazil's real fell over 2% against the dollar following the tariff announcement. Delta Air Lines (DAL) surged more than 12% in premarket trading after strong Q2 results, contributing to a rise in AAL and UAL stocks by 7.5%+. TSMC reported a 38.6% year-over-year increase in Q2 revenue to T$933.80 billion ($31.9 billion), driven by demand from the AI sector.

- **Actionable Insights**: Investors should monitor Brazilian market exposures and related stocks, as tariffs could create volatility. Delta's performance suggests a growing confidence in consumer spending on travel, indicating potential opportunities in the airlines sector. Keep an eye on TSMC's upcoming earnings report for further insights into the semiconductor and AI market.
